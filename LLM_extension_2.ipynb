      "\n",
      "In preparing the material for this book, the author has endeavored to\n",
      "arrange and discuss the subject matter in a way to be of the greatest\n",
      "service and help to the agricultural student and stockman, and place at\n",
      "their disposal a text and reference book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general discussions at the beginning of the different sections and\n",
      "chapters, and the discussions of the different diseases are naturally\n",
      "brief. An effort has been made to conveniently arrange the topics for both\n",
      "practical and class-room work. The chapters have been grouped under the\n",
      "necessary heads, with review questions at the end of each chapter, and the\n",
      "book divided into seven parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapters on diseases of the locomotory organs, the teeth, surgical\n",
      "diseases and castration, although not commonly discussed in books of this\n",
      "class, the writer believes will be of value for reference and instructional\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "When used as a text-book, it will be well for the instructor to supplement\n",
      "the text with class-room discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writer has given special emphasis to the cause and prevention of\n",
      "disease, and not so much to the medicinal treatment. Stockmen are not\n",
      "expected to practise the medicinal treatment, but rather the preventive\n",
      "treatment of disease. For this reason it is not deemed advisable to give a\n",
      "large number of formulas for the preparation of medicinal mixtures to be\n",
      "used for the treatment of disease, but such treatment is suggested in the\n",
      "most necessary cases.\n",

      "CHAPTER I\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION OF DISEASE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Disease is the general term for any deviation from the normal or healthy\n",
      "condition of the body. The morbid processes that result in either slight or\n",
      "marked modifications of the normal condition are recognized by the\n",
      "injurious changes in the structure or function of the organ, or group of\n",
      "body organs involved. The increase in the secretion of urine noticeable in\n",
      "horses in the late fall and winter is caused by the cool weather and the\n",
      "decrease in the perspiration. If, however, the increase in the quantity of\n",
      "urine secreted occurs independently of any normal cause and is accompanied\n",
      "by an unthrifty and weakened condition of the animal, it would then\n",
      "characterize disease. Tissues may undergo changes in order to adapt\n",
      "themselves to different environments, or as a means of protecting\n",
      "themselves against injuries. The coat of a horse becomes heavy and appears\n",
      "rough if the animal is exposed to severe cold. A rough, staring coat is\n",
      "very common in horses affected by disease. The outer layer of the skin\n",
      "becomes thickened when subject to pressure or friction from the harness.\n",
      "This change in structure is purely protective and normal. In disease the\n",
      "deviation from normal must be more permanent in character than it is in the\n",
      "examples mentioned above, and in some way prove injurious to the body\n",
      "functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLASSIFICATION.--We may divide diseases into three classes: _non-specific,\n",
      "specific_ and _parasitic_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Non-specific diseases_ have no constant cause. A variety of causes may\n",
      "produce the same disease. For example, acute indigestion may be caused by a\n",
      "change of diet, watering the animal after feeding grain, by exhaustion and\n",
      "intestinal worms. Usually, but one of the animals in the stable or herd is\n",
      "affected. If several are affected, it is because all have been subject to\n",
      "the same condition, and not because the disease has spread from one animal\n",
      "to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Specific Diseases._--The terms infectious and contagious are used in\n",
      "speaking of specific diseases. Much confusion exists in the popular use of\n",
      "these terms. A _contagious_ disease is one that may be transmitted by\n",
      "personal contact, as, for example, influenza, glanders and hog-cholera. As\n",
      "these diseases may be produced by indirect contact with the diseased animal\n",
      "as well as by direct, they are also _infectious_. There are a few germ\n",
      "diseases that are not spread by the healthy animals coming in direct\n",
      "contact with the diseased animal, as, for example, black leg and southern\n",
      "cattle fever. These are purely infectious diseases. Infection is a more\n",
      "comprehensive term than contagion, as it may be used in alluding to all\n",
      "germ diseases, while the use of the term contagion is rightly limited to\n",
      "such diseases as are produced principally through individual contact.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Parasitic diseases_ are very common among domestic animals. This class of\n",
      "disease is caused by insects and worms, as for example, lice, mites, ticks,\n",
      "flies, and round and flat worms that live at the expense of their hosts.\n",
      "They may invade any of the organs of the body, but most commonly inhabit\n",
      "the digestive tract and skin. Some of the parasitic insects, mosquitoes,\n",
      "flies and ticks, act as secondary hosts for certain animal microorganisms\n",
      "that they transmit to healthy individuals through the punctures or the\n",
      "bites that they are capable of producing in the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "CAUSES.--For convenience we may divide the causes of disease into the\n",
      "predisposing or indirect, and the exciting or direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The predisposing causes_ are such factors as tend to render the body more\n",
      "susceptible to disease or favor the presence of the exciting cause. For\n",
      "example, an animal that is narrow chested and lacking in the development of\n",
      "the vital organs lodged in the thoracic cavity, when exposed to the same\n",
      "condition as the other members of the herd, may contract disease while the\n",
      "animals having better conformation do not (Fig. 1). Hogs confined in\n",
      "well-drained yards and pastures that are free from filth, and fed in pens\n",
      "and on feeding floors that are clean, do not become hosts for large numbers\n",
      "of parasites. Hogs confined in filthy pens are frequently so badly infested\n",
      "with lice and intestinal worms that their health and thriftiness are\n",
      "seriously interfered with. In the first case mentioned the predisposition\n",
      "to disease is in the individual, and in the second case it is in the\n",
      "surroundings (Fig. 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Side and posterior view of bull showing\n",
      "conformation favorable to the development of disease.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The exciting causes_ are the immediate causes of the particular disease.\n",
      "Exciting causes usually operate through the environment. With the exception\n",
      "of the special disease-producing germs, the most common exciting causes are\n",
      "faulty food and faulty methods of feeding. The following predisposing\n",
      "causes of disease may be mentioned:\n",
      "\n",
      "_Age_ is an important factor in the production of disease. Young and\n",
      "immature animals are more prone to attacks of infectious diseases than are\n",
      "old and mature animals. Hog-cholera usually affects the young hogs in the\n",
      "herd first, while scours, suppurative joint disease and infectious sore\n",
      "mouth are diseases that occur during the first few days or few weeks of the\n",
      "animal's life. Lung and intestinal parasites are more commonly found in the\n",

      "understand the meaning of the many symptoms or signs of disease, we must\n",
      "possess knowledge of the structure and physiological functions of the\n",
      "different organs of the body. We must be familiar with the animal when it\n",
      "is in good health in order to be able to recognize any deviation from the\n",
      "normal due to disease, and we must learn from personal observation the\n",
      "different symptoms that characterize the different diseases. Stockmen\n",
      "should be able to tell when any of the animals in their care are sick as\n",
      "soon as the first symptom of disease manifests itself, by changes in the\n",
      "general appearance and behavior. But in order to ascertain the exact\n",
      "condition a general and systematic examination is necessary. The examiner,\n",

      "carefully, noting the behavior, appearance, surroundings, and general and\n",
      "local symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before making a _general examination_ of the animal it is well, if the\n",
      "examiner is not already acquainted with the history of the case (care, feed\n",
      "and surroundings), to learn as much about this from the attendant as is\n",

      "actions, or any other information that may be of assistance in forming the\n",
      "diagnosis and outlining the treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _general symptoms_ inform us regarding the condition of the different\n",
      "groups of body organs. A careful study of this group of symptoms enables us\n",
      "correctly to diagnose disease and inform ourselves as to the progress of\n",

      "The frequency of the pulse beat varies in the different species of animals.\n",
      "The smaller the animal the more frequent the pulse. In young animals the\n",
      "number of beats per minute is greater than in adults. Excitement or fear,\n",
      "especially if the animal possesses a nervous temperament, increases the\n",
      "frequency of the pulse. During, and for a short time after, feeding and\n",
      "exercise, the pulse rate is higher than when the animal is standing at\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following table gives the normal rate of the pulse beats per minute:\n",
      "\n",

      "varieties of pulse may be mentioned: _frequent, infrequent, quick, slow,\n",
      "large, small, hard, soft_ and _intermittent_. The terms frequent and\n",
      "infrequent refer to the number of pulse beats in a given time; quick and\n",
      "slow to the length of time required for the pulse wave to pass beneath the\n",
      "finger; large and small to the volume of the wave; hard and soft to its\n",
      "compressibility; and intermittent to the occasional missing of a beat. A\n",

      "region with the fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Cattle's pulse_ is taken from the same artery as in the horse. The artery\n",
      "is most superficial a little above the border of the jaw. It is more\n",
      "difficult to find the pulse wave in cattle than it is in horses, because of\n",
      "the larger amount of connective tissue just beneath the skin and the\n",
      "heavier muscles of the jaw. A very satisfactory pulse may be found in the\n",
      "small arteries located along the inferior part of the lateral region of the\n",
      "tail and near its base.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The sheep's pulse_ may be taken directly from the femoral artery by\n",
      "placing the fingers over the inner region of the thigh. By pressing with\n",
      "the hand over the region of the heart we may determine its condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The hog's pulse_ can easily be taken from the femoral artery on the\n",

      "Visible Mucous Membranes.--The visible mucous membranes, as they are\n",
      "termed, are the lining membranes of the eyelids, nostrils and nasal\n",
      "cavities, and mouth. In health they are usually a pale red, excepting when\n",
      "the animal is exercised or excited, when they appear a brighter red and\n",
      "somewhat vascular. In disease the following changes in color and appearance\n",
      "may be noted: When inflamed, as in cold in the head, a deep red; in\n",
      "impoverished or bloodless conditions of the body and in internal\n",

      "feeds, methods of feeding, care, sanitation and the use of such biological\n",
      "products as bacterins, vaccines and protective serums is of the greatest\n",
      "importance to the farmer and veterinarian. We are beginning to realize that\n",

      "well mixed with the feed. This is especially important if there are a\n",
      "number of animals to be treated, as there is more certainty of each animal\n",
      "getting the proper dose and the danger of overdosing is avoided. If the\n",

      "\n",
      "_Horses_ are sometimes difficult to drench, and it may be advisable to\n",
      "confine the horse in some way. Small drenches can readily be given with a\n",
      "syringe (Fig. 6) or a small bottle. In giving bulky drenches it is most\n",
      "convenient to use a long-necked, heavy glass bottle. The horse should be\n",
      "backed into a narrow stall and the head elevated by placing a loop in the\n",
      "end of a small rope over the upper jaw, passing the rope back of the nose\n",
      "piece on the halter and throwing it over a beam, and raising the head until\n",
      "the mouth is slightly higher than the throat. If the horse refuses to\n",
      "swallow, a tablespoonful of clean water may be dropped into the nostril.\n",
      "This forces it to swallow. A drench should never be given through the nose,\n",
      "as it may pass into the air passages and cause a fatal inflammation of the\n",

      "\n",
      "_Sheep_ may be drenched either in the standing position, or when thrown on\n",

      "_A herd of hogs_ may be quickly and easily drenched if they are confined in\n",
      "a small pen, and the loop of a small rope placed around the snout, well\n",
      "back toward the corners of the mouth. A small metal dose syringe should be\n",
      "used. If the drench is bulky and the hog difficult to hold, it may be\n",
      "necessary to elevate the head and raise the forefeet from the ground. The\n",
      "drench should not be given until the hog is quiet and well under control,\n",
      "as there is some danger of the medicine passing into the air passages and\n",
      "doing harm. It may be necessary to mark the hogs that have been drenched\n",

      "The administration of drugs enclosed in a gelatin capsule, or mixing them\n",
      "with syrup, honey or linseed oil, and rolling the mass into the form of a\n",
      "cylinder is commonly practised. The _capsule_ or _ball_ may then be shot\n",
      "into the pharynx with a balling gun. A ball may also be given to the larger\n",
      "animals by carrying it into the back part of the mouth with the hand, and\n",
      "placing it on the back part of the tongue. In the horse this method of\n",
      "administration requires some practice. The tongue must be pulled well\n",
      "forward, the head held up, and the tongue released as soon as the ball is\n",
      "placed on the tongue, so that it may pass back into the pharynx.\n",
      "\n",
      "The administration of drugs by _injecting beneath the skin_ (Fig. 7) is\n",
      "suitable when the drug is non-irritating and the dose is small. Drugs\n",
      "administered in this way act promptly and energetically. The alkaloid or\n",
      "active principle of the drug is commonly used. A fold of the skin is picked\n",
      "up with the fingers and the needle is quickly introduced, care being taken\n",
      "not to prick or scratch the muscular tissue, as this causes some pain and\n",
      "makes the animal restless. In order to avoid abscess formation at the point\n",

      "kill intestinal parasites; to reduce body temperature; to administer\n",
      "medicine; and to supply the animal with food. An enema may be administered\n",

      "three feet or by using an injection pump. In the larger animals several\n",
      "feet of heavy walled rubber tubing carrying a straight nozzle at one end\n",
      "should be used. In administering an enema, the rectum should be emptied out\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The organs that form the digestive tract are the mouth, pharynx,\n",
      "oesophagus, stomach, intestines and the annexed glands, viz.: the salivary,\n",
      "liver, and pancreas. The development of these organs differs in the\n",
      "different species of animals. For example, solipeds possess a small, simple\n",
      "stomach and capacious, complicated intestines. Just the opposite is true of\n",
      "ruminants. The different species of ruminants possess a large, complicated\n",
      "stomach, and comparatively simple intestines. In swine we meet with a more\n",
      "highly developed stomach than that of solipeds and a more simple intestinal\n",
      "tract. Of all domestic animals the most simple digestive tract occurs in\n",
      "the dog. These variations in the development of the different organs of\n",
      "digestion, together with the difference in the character of the feed and\n",
      "method of feeding, cause a variation in the kind of diseases met with in\n",
      "the different species. The complicated stomach of ruminants predispose them\n",
      "to diseases of this portion of the digestive tract. Because of their\n",
      "complicated intestinal tract solipeds are prone to intestinal disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISEASES OF THE MOUTH\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The mouth is the first division of the digestive\n",
      "tract. It is formed by the lips, cheeks, palate, soft palate, tongue and\n",
      "teeth. Here the feed is acted on mechanically. It is broken up by the teeth\n",
      "and moved about until mixed with the saliva and put into condition to pass\n",
      "through the pharynx and along the oesophagus to the stomach. The mechanical\n",
      "change that the feed is subject to is very imperfect in dogs. In the horse\n",
      "it is a slow, thorough process, although greedy feeders are not uncommon.\n",
      "The first mastication in the ox is three times quicker than in horses, but\n",
      "the process of rumination is slow and thorough.\n",
      "\n",
      "STOMATITIS.--Simple inflammation of the mouth is frequently met with in\n",
      "horses. Ulcerative or infectious inflammation commonly occurs in young, and\n",
      "occasionally in old, debilitated animals. This form of sore mouth will be\n",
      "discussed along with other infectious diseases, and the following\n",
      "discussion will be confined to the non-infectious form of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ are irritation from the bit, sharp teeth, irritating drenches,\n",
      "roughage that contains beards or awns of grasses and grains, and burrs that\n",
      "wound the lining membrane of the mouth. Febrile, or digestive disorders, or\n",
      "any condition that may interfere with feeding, may cause this disorder. In\n",
      "the latter cases the mucous membrane of the mouth is not cleansed by the\n",
      "saliva. Particles of feed may decompose and irritating organisms set up an\n",
      "inflammation. Putrid or decomposed slops, hot feeds, irritating drenches\n",
      "and drinking from filthy wallows are common causes of inflammation of the\n",
      "mouth in hogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different cases and species. Slight or localized\n",
      "inflammation of the mouth is usually overlooked by the attendant. Lampas of\n",
      "horses may be considered a local inflammation involving the palate.\n",
      "Lacerations of the cheek or tongue by the teeth, or irritating feed,\n",
      "usually result in a slight interference with prehension and mastication and\n",
      "more or less salivation. Salivation from this cause should not be confused\n",
      "with salivation resulting from feeding on white clover.\n",
      "\n",
      "In generalized inflammation of the mucous membrane, the first symptom\n",
      "usually noticed is the inability to eat. On examining the mouth we find the\n",
      "mucous membrane inflamed, hot and dry. A part may appear coated. In a short\n",
      "time the odor from the mouth is fetid. Following this dry stage of the\n",
      "inflammation is the period of salivation. Saliva dribbles from the mouth,\n",
      "and in severe cases it is mixed with white, stringy shreds of epithelium\n",
      "and tinged with blood. In less acute forms of the disease, we may notice\n",
      "little blisters or vesicles scattered over the lining membrane of the lips,\n",
      "cheeks and tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acute form of stomatitis runs a short course, usually a few days, and\n",
      "responds readily to treatment. Localized inflammation caused by irritation\n",
      "from teeth, or feeding irritating feeds, does not respond so readily to\n",
      "treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is largely preventive and consists largely in removing the\n",
      "cause. When the mouth is inflamed, roughage should be fed rather sparingly,\n",
      "and soft feeds such as slops, mashes, or gruels given in place of the\n",
      "regular diet. Plenty of clean drinking water should be provided. In the way\n",
      "of medicinal treatment antiseptic and astringent washes are indicated. A\n",
      "four per cent water solution of boric acid may be used, or a one-half per\n",
      "cent water solution of a high grade coal-tar disinfectant. The mouth should\n",
      "be thoroughly irrigated twice daily until the mucous surfaces appear\n",
      "normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "DEPRAVED APPETITE\n",
      "\n",
      "A depraved appetite is met with in all species of farm animals, but it is\n",
      "especially common in ruminants. It should not be classed as a disease, but\n",
      "more correctly as a bad habit, or symptom of innutrition or indigestion.\n",
      "The animals affected seem to have an irresistible desire to lick, chew and\n",
      "swallow indigestible and disgusting objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The common cause_ of depraved appetite is the feeding of a ration\n",
      "deficient in certain food elements. A ration deficient in protein or in\n",
      "salts is said to cause this disorder. Lack of exercise, or confinement,\n",
      "innutrition, and a depraved sense of taste may favor the development of\n",
      "this disease. For example, when sheep are housed closely they may contract\n",
      "the habit of chewing one another's fleeces. Lambs are especially apt to\n",
      "contract this habit when suckling ewes that have on their udders long wool\n",
      "soiled with urine and faeces.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The first symptom_ is the desire to chew, lick or eat indigestible or\n",
      "filthy substances. Horses and cattle may stand and lick a board for an hour\n",
      "or more; cattle may chew the long hair from the tails of horses; sheep may\n",
      "nibble wool; sows may within a short time after giving birth to their pigs,\n",
      "kill and eat them; chickens may pick and eat feathers. Innutrition may\n",
      "accompany the abnormal appetite, as very frequently the affected animal\n",
      "shows a disposition to leave its feed in order to eat these injurious and\n",
      "innutritions substances. In ruminants, the wool or hair may form balls and\n",
      "obstruct the opening into the third compartment, causing chronic\n",
      "indigestion and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in the removal of the cause. Feeding a ration that\n",
      "meets the needs of the system, clean quarters and plenty of exercise are\n",
      "the most important preventive lines of treatment. In such cases medicinal\n",
      "treatment (saline and bitter tonics) may be indicated. It is usually\n",
      "advisable to remove the affected animals from the herd or flock in order to\n",
      "prevent others from imitating them.\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE STOMACH\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a remarkable difference in the development of the stomachs of\n",
      "solipeds and ruminants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse's stomach (Fig. 8) is simple and has a capacity of three or four\n",
      "gallons. The left portion is lined with a cuticular mucous membrane, and\n",
      "the right portion with a glandular mucous membrane that has in it the\n",
      "glands that secrete the gastric juice. The most important digestive change\n",
      "in the feed is the action of the gastric juice on the proteids and their\n",
      "conversion into the simpler products, proteoses and peptones.\n",
      "\n",

      "[Illustration: FIG. 10.--A section of the wall of the rumen and reticulum,\n",
      "showing the oesophageal groove: lips of groove; opening from\n",
      "oesophagus; and opening into omasum.]\n",
      "\n",
      "RUMINANTS have a compound stomach (Figs. 9 and 10). The capacity of the\n",
      "stomach of the ox is between twenty and thirty gallons. The four\n",
      "compartments into which it is divided are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and\n",
      "abomasum or true stomach. The rumen is the largest compartment, with a\n",
      "capacity of more than twenty gallons. The reticulum is the smallest, with a\n",
      "capacity of about one-half gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a brief mastication, the food passes directly to the _rumen_. Here it\n",
      "is subjected to a churning movement that mixes and presses the contents of\n",
      "the rumen forward in the direction of the oesophageal opening, where it is\n",
      "ready for regurgitation. It is then carried back to the mouth, remasticated\n",
      "and returned to the rumen. This is termed rumination. All food material\n",
      "that is sufficiently broken up is directed toward the opening into the\n",
      "third compartment by the oesophageal grove (Fig. 10), a demi-canal that\n",
      "connects this with the oesophageal opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third compartment, the _omasum_, communicates anteriorly with the\n",
      "second and first, and posteriorly with the fourth compartment or true\n",
      "stomach. The interior arrangement of this compartment is most singular. It\n",
      "is divided by a number of large folds of the lining membrane between which\n",
      "are smaller folds. It is between these folds that the contents pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first three compartments possess no glands capable of secreting a\n",
      "digestive juice. However, important digestive changes occur. The\n",
      "carbohydrates are digested by means of enzymes contained in the feed. The\n",
      "most important function of the rumen and omasum is the maceration of the\n",
      "fibrous substances, and the digestion of the cellulose. Between sixty and\n",
      "seventy per cent of the cellulose is digested in the rumen.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The abomasum_ is lined by a gastric mucous membrane. The gastric juice\n",
      "secreted converts the protein into peptones. In the young a milk curdling\n",
      "ferment is also secreted by the glands of this compartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE STOMACH OF THE HOG is a type between the carnivora and ruminant. The\n",
      "digestive changes may be divided into four stages. The first period is one\n",
      "of starch conversion; the second period is the same, only more pronounced;\n",
      "the third period, both starch and protein conversion occurs; and the fourth\n",
      "period is taken up mostly with protein digestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACUTE INDIGESTION OF THE STOMACH OF SOLIPEDS.--Diseases of the stomach are\n",
      "less common in solipeds than in ruminants. The simple stomach of the horse\n",
      "and the comparatively unimportant place that it occupies in the digestion\n",
      "of the feed renders it less subject to disease. Only under the most\n",
      "unfavorable conditions for digestion of the feed does this class of\n",
      "disorders occur. Acute indigestion in the form of overloading and\n",

      "\n",
      "_The predisposing causes_ that have to do with the development of these\n",
      "disorders, are the small capacity of the stomach and the location and\n",
      "smallness of the openings leading from the oesophagus and into the small\n",
      "intestines. Greedy eaters are more prone to indigestion than animals that\n",
      "eat slowly and are fed intelligently.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Dilated stomach of horse.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The following exciting causes_ may be mentioned: Sudden changes in ration;\n",
      "feeding too much green feed or grain; feeding frozen or decomposed feeds;\n",
      "drinking ice-cold water; and violent exercise or work that the animal is\n",
      "not accustomed to, immediately after feeding are the common\n",
      "disease-producing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ may vary from impaired appetite and slight restlessness to\n",
      "violent, colicky pains. In the large majority of cases the attendant is\n",
      "unable to differentiate between this and other forms of acute indigestion.\n",
      "The characteristic symptoms are attempts at regurgitation and vomiting,\n",
      "assuming a dog-sitting position and finally such nervous symptoms as\n",
      "champing of the jaws, staggering movement and extreme dulness.\n",
      "\n",

      "the omasum.\n",
      "\n",
      "TYMPANITES, \"BLOATING.\"--This disorder is usually caused by animals feeding\n",
      "on green feeds, such as clover, alfalfa and green corn, that ferment\n",
      "readily. Stormy, rainy weather seems to favor bloating. The consumption of\n",
      "spoiled feeds such as potatoes and beets may cause it. The drinking of a\n",
      "large quantity of water, especially if cold, chills the wall of the rumen\n",
      "and interferes with its movement. Frozen feeds may act in the same way.\n",
      "Sudden changes in the feed, inflammation of the rumen, and a weak\n",
      "peristaltic movement of the paunch resulting from disease or insufficient\n",
      "nourishment are frequent causes. It may occur in chronic disease. In\n",
      "tuberculosis, bloating sometimes occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are as follows: The paunch or rumen occupies the left side\n",
      "of the abdominal cavity, hence the distention of the abdominal wall by the\n",
      "collecting of gas in the rumen occurs principally on that side. The gas\n",
      "forms quickly and the distended wall is highly elastic and resonant. The\n",
      "animal stops eating and ruminating, the back may be arched and the ears\n",
      "droop. In the more severe cases the wall of the abdomen is distended on\n",
      "both sides, the respirations are quickened and labored, the pulse small and\n",
      "quick, the eyes are prominent and the mucous membrane congested. Death\n",
      "results from asphyxia brought on by the distended paunch pushing forward\n",
      "and interfering with the movement of the lungs and the absorption of the\n",
      "poisonous gases.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and medicinal. This form of acute\n",
      "indigestion can be largely prevented by practising the following preventive\n",
      "measures: All changes in the feed should be made gradually, especially if\n",
      "the ration fed is heavy, or the new ration consists largely of green,\n",
      "succulent feed. Cattle pasturing on clover should be kept under close\n",
      "observation. It is not advisable to pasture cattle on rank growths of\n",
      "clover that are wet with dew or a light rain. Bloating can be quickly\n",
      "relieved by puncturing the wall of the paunch with the trocar and cannula.\n",
      "The operation is quite simple and is not followed by bad results. The\n",
      "instrument is plunged through the walls of the abdomen and rumen in the\n",
      "most prominent portion of the flank, midway between the border of the last\n",
      "rib and the point of the haunch (Fig. 13). The trocar is then withdrawn\n",
      "from the cannula. After the gas has escaped through the cannula, the trocar\n",
      "is replaced and the instrument withdrawn. After using the trocar and\n",
      "cannula, the instrument should be cleaned by placing it in boiling hot\n",
      "water. It is advisable to wash the skin at the seat of the operation with a\n",
      "disinfectant before operating. In chronic tympanitis, it is sometimes\n",
      "advisable to leave the cannula in position by tying a tape to the flange,\n",
      "passing it around the body and tying.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a cathartic for cattle, we may give one quart of linseed and from two to\n",
      "four ounces of turpentine, or one to two pounds of Epsom or Glauber's\n",
      "salts, dissolved in plenty of water. Sheep may be given about one-fourth\n",
      "the dose recommended for cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The X indicates the point where the wall of flank\n",
      "and rumen are punctured with trocar and cannula in \"bloat.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "OVERLOADING THE RUMEN.--This form of indigestion occurs when ruminants have\n",
      "access to feeds that they are not accustomed to. As a result, they eat\n",
      "greedily and the mass of feed in the rumen becomes so heavy that the walls\n",
      "of the organ can not move it about, and digestion is interfered with. This\n",
      "is especially true of succulent feeds. A diseased condition of the animal\n",
      "predisposes it to this disorder. If after eating an excessive amount of\n",
      "dry, innutritions fodder, the animal drinks freely of cold water, acute\n",
      "symptoms of overloading are manifested.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The general symptoms_ occurring in overloading resembles those seen in\n",
      "bloating. The symptoms may be mild and extend over a period of several\n",
      "days, or it may take on a highly acute form, terminating fatally within a\n",
      "few hours. The acuteness of the attack depends on the character and\n",
      "quantity of feed eaten. If a large quantity of green feed is eaten,\n",
      "fermentation occurs and the animal may die within a few hours. The swelling\n",
      "on the left side has a doughy feel. It is not as elastic and resonant as in\n",
      "bloat, even when complicated by some gas formation. The animal may stop\n",
      "ruminating, refuse to eat, and act dull. In the more severe cases the\n",
      "respirations are hurried and labored, the pulse small and quick and the\n",
      "expression of the face indicates pain. Colicky pains sometimes occur. Death\n",
      "may occur from shock or asphyxia.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. This disease can be\n",
      "prevented by using the necessary precautions to prevent animals from\n",
      "overeating. If gas forms, the trocar and cannula should be used. A drench\n",
      "of from one to two pounds of Epsom or Glauber's salts should be given.\n",
      "Sheep may be given from four to six ounces of Epsom or Glauber's salts. We\n",
      "should endeavor to stimulate the movement of the paunch by pressure on the\n",
      "flank with the hand, throwing cold water on the wall of the abdomen and by\n",
      "hypodermic injections of strychnine. Rumenotomy should be performed when\n",
      "necessary. This operation consists in opening the walls of the abdomen and\n",
      "rumen, and removing a part of the contents of the rumen. This is not a\n",
      "dangerous operation when properly performed, and should not be postponed\n",
      "until the animal is too weak to make a recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPACTION OF THE OMASUM.--This disease may occur as a complication of other\n",
      "forms of acute indigestion and diseases accompanied by an abnormal body\n",
      "temperature. Feeds that are dry and innutritions commonly cause it. Other\n",
      "causes are an excessive quantity of feed, sudden changes in the diet and\n",
      "drinking an insufficient quantity of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in other diseases of the stomach, the appetite is diminished, rumination\n",
      "ceases or occurs at irregular intervals, and the animal is more or less\n",
      "feverish. Bloating and constipation may occur. The animal may lose flesh,\n",
      "is weak, walks stiffly and grunts as though in pain when it moves about in\n",
      "the stall and at each respiration. In the acute form, marked symptoms are\n",
      "sometimes manifested. At first the animal acts drowsy; later violent\n",
      "nervous symptoms may develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The course_ of this disease varies from a few days to several weeks. Death\n",
      "frequently occurs. Frequently a diarrhoea accompanies recovery, a portion\n",
      "of the faeces appearing black with polished surfaces, as though they had\n",
      "been baked.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in practising the necessary precautions\n",
      "against the development of this disease by avoiding sudden changes in the\n",
      "feed, the feeding of dry, innutritions feeds in too large amounts, allowing\n",
      "animals plenty of water and providing them with salt. The best purgative to\n",
      "give is Glauber's or Epsom salts in from one- to two-pound doses, dissolved\n",
      "in at least one gallon of water. This physic may be repeated in from twelve\n",
      "to eighteen hours if necessary. Two drachms of tincture of nux vomica and\n",
      "one ounce of alcohol may be given in a drench three times daily. Hypodermic\n",
      "injections of strychnine, eserine, or pilocarpine are useful in the\n",
      "treatment of this disease. When recovery begins, the animal should be\n",
      "allowed moderate exercise and be fed food of a laxative nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "FOREIGN BODIES IN THE STOMACH OF RUMINANTS.--Foreign bodies such as hair\n",
      "balls and wire are very commonly found in the reticulum. This is because of\n",
      "the habits of this class of animals. Cattle eat their feed hastily and do\n",
      "not pick it over as carefully as does the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smooth, round objects do no appreciable harm unless they block the opening\n",
      "into the third compartment of the stomach. This frequently occurs in\n",
      "wool-eating lambs. Sharp-pointed objects may penetrate the surrounding\n",
      "tissues or such organs as the spleen, diaphragm, and pericardial sack. If\n",
      "these organs are injured by the foreign body serious symptoms develop. The\n",
      "_general symptoms_ are pain, fever, weakness and marked emaciation. It is\n",
      "very difficult to form a correct diagnosis, as the disease comes on without\n",
      "any apparent cause. Sometimes a swelling is noticed in the right and\n",
      "inferior abdominal region. If the heart becomes injured, symptoms of\n",
      "pericarditis are manifested.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Special care should be used to avoid\n",
      "getting foreign substances into the feed given to cattle. The feed troughs\n",
      "should be kept clean; we should avoid dropping nails and staples into the\n",
      "feed when repairing the silo or grain bin; and pieces of baling wire should\n",
      "be removed from straw or hay. Feeds known to be dirty should be run through\n",
      "a fanning mill before feeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH OF SWINE.--Overloading and feeding spoiled feed\n",
      "are _common causes_ of inflammation of the stomach. Swill-fed hogs are most\n",
      "commonly affected with this disorder. Overloading more often results in an\n",
      "inflammation of the stomach if the overloading follows the feeding of a\n",
      "light ration, and the weather is extremely warm. Hogs that are accustomed\n",
      "to eating salt may eat too much of it when fed to them after it is withheld\n",
      "for a week or longer, and a large quantity of water is taken soon\n",
      "afterwards. Slop containing alkaline washing powders and soaps irritate the\n",
      "stomach and intestines and cause a serious inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are loss of appetite, restlessness and sometimes colicky\n",
      "pains. The hog usually wanders off by itself, acts dull, grunts, lies down\n",
      "in a quiet place or stands with the back arched and the abdomen held tense.\n",
      "Vomiting commonly occurs. Sometimes the animal has a diarrhoea. The body\n",
      "temperature may be above normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in avoiding irritating feeds and sudden changes in\n",
      "the kind or quantity of feed fed. Drenching with hot water, or with about\n",
      "one ounce of ipecacuan may be practised. From one to three ounces of castor\n",
      "oil, depending on the size of the hog, may be given. After recovery the\n",
      "hogs should be confined in a comfortable pen and fed an easily digested\n",
      "ration.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The intestinal tract of solipeds is the best developed\n",
      "of any of the domestic animals (Fig. 14). It is divided into two portions,\n",
      "_small_ and _large_. The _small intestine_ is a little over seventy feet in\n",
      "length and about one and one-half inches in diameter. The mucous membrane\n",
      "lining presents a large absorbing surface and is well supplied with\n",
      "absorbing vessels that take up the sugars, proteids and fats, which are\n",
      "finally distributed to the body cells by the blood capillaries. In addition\n",
      "to these absorbing vessels the mucous membrane contains intestinal glands\n",
      "that secrete the intestinal juice. Other digestive secretions from the\n",
      "pancreatic gland and the liver are poured into the small intestine near its\n",
      "origin. These digestive juices act on the proteids, sugars, starches and\n",
      "fats, changing them into substances that are capable of being absorbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Photograph of model of digestive tract of horse:\n",
      "oesophagus; stomach; liver; small intestine; large intestine; spleen.]\n",
      "\n",
      "After disengaging itself from the mass of loops lodged in the region of the\n",
      "left flank, the small intestine crosses to the region of the right flank,\n",
      "where it terminates in the first division of the large intestine.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The large intestine_ is formed by the following divisions: caecum, double\n",
      "colon, floating colon and rectum. The caecum is a large blind pouch that\n",
      "has a capacity of about seven gallons. The double colon is the largest\n",
      "division of the intestines. It is about twelve feet in length and has a\n",
      "capacity of about eighteen gallons. This portion of the intestine\n",
      "terminates in the region of the left flank in the floating colon. The\n",
      "latter is about ten feet in length and about twice the diameter of the\n",
      "small intestine, from which it can readily be distinguished by its\n",
      "sacculated walls. The rectum is the terminal portion of the intestinal\n",
      "tract. It is about one and one-half feet in length and possesses heavy,\n",
      "elastic walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fermentation and cellulose digestion occur in the caecum and double colon.\n",
      "It is in the floating colon that the faeces are moulded into balls. The\n",
      "faeces are retained in the rectum until defecation takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _intestinal tract of cattle_ is longer than that of solipeds and the\n",
      "different divisions are not as well defined as in the horse's intestine and\n",
      "about one-half its diameter. The large intestine is about thirty-five feet\n",
      "in length and its capacity six or seven gallons (Fig. 15).\n",
      "\n",
      "ACUTE INTESTINAL INDIGESTION OF SOLIPEDS.--Acute indigestion is more common\n",
      "in horses and mules than it is in any of the other domestic animals.\n",
      "Because of the difference in the causes and symptoms manifested, we may\n",
      "divide it into the following forms: spasmodic, flatulent and obstruction\n",
      "colic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The predisposing causes_ are general and digestive debility resulting from\n",
      "the feeding of an insufficient or unsuitable ration, and general and\n",
      "parasitic diseases of the intestine. Nervous, well-bred horses are most\n",
      "susceptible to nervous or spasmodic colic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The direct causes_ are improper methods of feeding and watering; giving\n",
      "the animal severe or unusual exercise immediately before or after feeding;\n",
      "the feeding of spoiled or green feeds and new grains; chilling of the body;\n",
      "imperfect mastication of feed because of defective teeth; obstruction of\n",
      "the intestine by worms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feeding of grain at a time when the animal is not in fit condition to\n",
      "digest it results in imperfect digestion in both the stomach and intestine.\n",
      "This leads to irritation of the intestine and abnormal fermentation of its\n",
      "contents. The drinking of a large quantity of water immediately after\n",
      "feeding grain flushes at least a part of the undigested grain from the\n",
      "stomach through the small intestine and into the caecum. New grains, such\n",
      "as new oats, are hurried along the small intestine and reach the large\n",
      "intestine practically undigested. The two latter conditions are common\n",
      "causes of _flatulent_ or _wind colic_. Sudden change in the ration,\n",
      "especially to a green feed, may result in intestinal irritation and\n",
      "flatulence.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Photograph of model of digestive tract of\n",

      "and large intestine.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Horses that are greedy feeders and have sharp, uneven, smooth or diseased\n",
      "teeth are unable to masticate the feed properly. This results in\n",
      "unthriftiness caused by imperfect digestion and assimilation of the feed.\n",
      "Such animals usually suffer from a catarrhal or chronic inflammation of the\n",
      "intestine, and may have periodic attacks of acute indigestion or colic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Obstruction colic_ is very often caused by the feeding of too much\n",
      "roughage in the form of straw, shredded fodder, or hay. Debility often\n",
      "contributes to this form of indigestion, and the double colon may become\n",
      "badly impacted with alimentary matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worms may irritate the intestinal mucous membrane and interfere with\n",
      "digestion, obstruct the intestine and cause debility and circulatory\n",
      "disturbances. The large round worm may form a tangled mass and completely\n",
      "fill a portion of the double colon.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A yearling colt that died of aneurism colic.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some species attach themselves to the intestinal wall, suck the blood of\n",
      "the host and cause anaemia and debility. Colic resulting from _circulatory\n",
      "disturbances_ is not common. The female of a certain species of\n",
      "_strongulus_ deposits eggs in the mucous membrane. On hatching, the larvae\n",
      "may enter a blood capillary, drift along in the blood stream and finally\n",
      "come to rest in a large blood-vessel that supplies a certain portion of the\n",
      "intestines with blood. Here the parasite develops. The wall of the vessel\n",
      "becomes irritated and inflamed, pieces of fibrin flake off and drift along\n",
      "the blood stream until finally a vessel too small for the floating particle\n",
      "to pass through is reached and the vessel becomes plugged. The loop of\n",
      "intestine supplied by it receives no blood. A temporary paralysis of the\n",
      "loop occurs, which persists until a second vessel is able to take over the\n",
      "function of the one that is plugged. This form of colic is most common in\n",
      "old horses (Fig. 16).\n",
      "\n",
      "Such complications of acute indigestion as _twisting, infolding_ and\n",
      "_displacement of the intestine_ may occur. It is not uncommon for a\n",
      "stallion to suffer from strangulated hernia, due to a rather large internal\n",
      "inguinal ring and a loop of the intestine passing through it and into the\n",
      "inguinal canal or scrotum. Such displacements are usually accompanied by\n",
      "severe colicky pains.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different cases. In the mild form, the colicky\n",
      "pains are not prominent, but in the acute form, the animal is restless,\n",

      "especially marked when the abdominal pain is severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "_In the spasmodic form_ the attack comes on suddenly, the colicky pains are\n",
      "severe, and the peristaltic movement of the intestine is marked and\n",
      "accompanied by loud intestinal sounds. In most cases of indigestion\n",
      "characterized by fermentation and collections of gas in the intestine there\n",
      "is gastric tympany as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acute indigestion characterized by _impaction_ of the large intestine\n",

      "pain is not severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Congestion and inflammation_ of the intestine may result from the\n",
      "irritation produced by the feed. When this occurs, the abdominal pain is\n",

      "and the respirations and pulse beats may be quickened.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large percentage of the cases of acute indigestion terminate fatally. The\n",
      "course of the disease varies from a few hours to several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both _preventive_ and _curative_. The preventive\n",
      "treatment is by far the most important. This consists in observing right\n",
      "methods of feeding and caring for horses. The attendant should note the\n",
      "condition of the animal before feeding grain, feed regularly and avoid\n",
      "sudden changes in feed. If a horse has received unusual exercise, it is\n",
      "proper to feed hay first, and when the animal is cooled out, water and feed\n",
      "grain. Drinking a small quantity of water when tired or following a meal is\n",
      "not injurious, but a large quantity of water taken at such times is\n",
      "injurious and dangerous to the health of the animal. The feeding of spoiled\n",
      "or mouldy feeds to horses is highly injurious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse should be given a roomy, comfortable stall that is well bedded,\n",
      "or a clean grass lot. If the attack appears when the animal is in harness,\n",
      "we should stop working it and remove the harness immediately. Work or\n",
      "exercise usually aggravates the case and may cause congestion and\n",
      "inflammation of important body organs. In cold weather the animal should be\n",
      "protected by blankets. If the pain is violent, sedatives may be given. The\n",
      "gaseous disturbances should be relieved by puncturing the wall of the\n",
      "intestine with the trocar and cannula. Rectal injections of cold water may\n",
      "be resorted to. Fluid extract of cannabis indica in quarter ounce doses and\n",
      "repeated in one hour may be given in linseed oil. In all cases it is\n",
      "advisable to drench the animal with one pint of raw linseed oil and two\n",
      "ounces of turpentine. Strychnine, eserine and pilocarpine are the drugs\n",
      "commonly used by the veterinarians in the treatment of acute indigestion.\n",
      "Small and repeated doses of the above drugs are preferred to large doses.\n",
      "This is one of the diseases that requires prompt and skilled attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharp, uneven or diseased teeth should receive the necessary attention. In\n",

      "\n",
      "Insanitary conditions, such as dark, cold, damp, filthy quarters, lower the\n",

      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are as follows: Constipation accompanied by a feverish\n",
      "condition precedes the diarrhoea; colicky pains are sometimes manifested;\n",
      "the diarrhoea is usually accompanied by depression, falling off in appetite\n",
      "and weakness. At first the intestinal discharges are not very foul\n",
      "smelling; later the odor is very disagreeable. The faeces may be made up\n",
      "largely of undigested, decomposed milk that adheres to the tail and hind\n",
      "parts. If the diarrhoea is severe, the animal refuses to suckle or drink\n",
      "from the pail, and loses flesh rapidly. It is usually found lying down. The\n",
      "ears droop and the depression is marked. The body temperature may vary from\n",
      "several degrees above to below the average normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The infectious form_ of white scours may be diagnosed by the history of\n",

      "are affected and the death-rate is very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calves and lambs frequently die of an acute congestion of the fourth\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OF POULTRY\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The digestive tract of poultry is composed of the\n",
      "following organs: mouth, gullet, crop, stomach, gizzard and intestines,\n",
      "with the two large glands, the liver and pancreas. The digestion of the\n",
      "feed begins in the crop. Here the feed is held for a short time, mixed with\n",
      "certain fluids and softened. On reaching the stomach it becomes mixed with\n",
      "the digestive fluid secreted by the gastric glands. This second digestive\n",
      "action consists in thoroughly soaking the feed in the gastric juice, making\n",
      "it soft and preparing it for maceration by the heavily muscled gizzard.\n",
      "Following maceration it passes into the intestine. It is here that the\n",
      "digestive action is completed and absorption occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the conditions of domestication, poultry are subject to a great\n",
      "variety of intestinal disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISEASES OF THE CROP.--Impaction and inflammation are the two common\n",
      "diseases of the crop. _Large, impacted crops_ are usually caused by the\n",
      "feeding of too much dry feed, fermentation of the contents of the crop and\n",
      "foreign bodies that obstruct the opening from the organ.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Inflammation of the crop_ is caused by excessive use of condiments in the\n",
      "feed, putrid or spoiled feeds and eating caustic drugs, such as lime and\n",
      "rat poison.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are dulness, an indisposition to move about, drooping wings\n",
      "and efforts to eject gases and liquids. The crop is found greatly distended\n",
      "and either hard or soft, depending on the quantity of feed present and the\n",
      "cause of the distention. If fermentation is present the crop usually feels\n",
      "soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in practising proper methods of\n",
      "feeding. The _curative treatment_ of a recent case consists in manipulating\n",
      "the mass of feed, breaking it up and forcing it upwards toward the mouth.\n",
      "If difficulty in breaking up the mass is experienced, it is advisable to\n",
      "administer a tablespoonful of castor oil to the bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the above manipulations are unsuccessful, an operation is necessary.\n",
      "This consists in making an opening through the skin and the wall of the\n",
      "crop and removing the contents with tweezers. The opening must be closed\n",
      "with sutures. The proper aseptic precautions must be observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In inflammation of the crop, the bird should be dieted for at least one\n",
      "day, and one teaspoonful of castor oil given as a laxative.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACUTE AND CHRONIC INDIGESTION.--The recognition of special forms of\n",
      "indigestion in poultry is difficult. A flock of poultry that is subject to\n",
      "careless and indifferent care may not thrive and a number of the birds\n",
      "develop digestive disorders. This may be indicated by an abnormal or\n",
      "depraved appetite and emaciated condition. Constipation or diarrhoea may\n",
      "occur. In the more severe cases the bird acts dull, the feathers are\n",
      "ruffled and it moves about very little.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in removing the cause, and giving the flock a\n",
      "tonic mixture in the feed. The following mixture may be used: powdered\n",
      "gentian and powdered ginger, eight ounces of each, Glauber's salts four\n",
      "ounces, and sulfate of iron two ounces. One ounce of the above mixture may\n",
      "be given in ten pounds of feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHITE DIARRHOEA OF YOUNG CHICKENS.--White diarrhoea is of the greatest\n",
      "economic importance to the poultryman. The loss of chicks from this disease\n",
      "is greater than the combined loss resulting from all other diseases. It is\n",
      "stated by some authors that not less than fifty per cent of the chickens\n",
      "hatched die from white diarrhoea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a heavy death-rate as is attributed to this disease can not result\n",
      "from improper methods of handling and insanitary conditions. Before it was\n",
      "proven that white diarrhoea was caused by specific germs, a great deal of\n",
      "emphasis was placed on such causes as debilitated breeding stock, improper\n",
      "incubation, poorly ventilated, overcrowded brooders, too high or too low\n",
      "temperatures and filth. Such conditions are important predisposing factors,\n",
      "and may, in isolated cases, result in serious intestinal disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The microorganisms causing_ this disease belong to both the plant and\n",
      "animal kingdoms. Infection usually occurs within a day or two following\n",
      "hatching. Chicks two or three weeks of age seldom develop the acute form of\n",
      "the disease. Incubator chicks are the most susceptible to the disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The following symptoms occur_: The chicks present a droopy, sleepy\n",
      "appearance; the eyes are closed, and the chicks huddle together and peep\n",
      "much of the time; the whitish intestinal discharge is noticed adhering to\n",
      "the fluff near the margins of the vent, and the young bird is very weak;\n",
      "death may occur within the first few days. After the first two weeks the\n",
      "disease becomes less acute. In the highly acute form the chicks die without\n",
      "showing the usual train of symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very easy to differentiate between the infectious and the\n",
      "non-infectious diarrhoea. In the latter, the percentage of chicks affected\n",
      "is small and the disease responds to treatment more readily than does the\n",
      "infectious form. The death-rate in the latter form is about eighty per\n",
      "cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ of diarrhoea in chicks from any cause is preventive. This\n",
      "consists in removing the cause. No person can successfully handle poultry\n",
      "if he does not give the necessary attention to sanitation. Poultry houses,\n",
      "runs, watering fountains and feeding places must be constantly cleaned and\n",
      "disinfected. The degree of attention necessary depends on the surroundings,\n",
      "the crowded condition of the poultry houses and runs, and the presence of\n",
      "disease in the flock. If disease is present, we can not clean and disinfect\n",
      "the quarters too often. The attendant can not overlook details in handling\n",
      "the incubator or brooder and feeding the chicks and be uniformly\n",
      "successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the disease is known to be present in the flock, the incubators and\n",
      "brooders should be thoroughly disinfected by fumigating them with\n",
      "formaldehyde gas. If dirty, they should first be washed with a water\n",
      "solution of a good disinfectant. For a period of from twenty-four to\n",
      "forty-eight hours after hatching, the chicks should receive no feed. Dr.\n",
      "Kaupp recommends as an intestinal antiseptic, sulfocarbolate thirty grains,\n",
      "bichloride of mercury six grains, and citric acid three grains, dissolved\n",
      "in one gallon of water. This solution should be kept in front of the chicks\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE LIVER\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The liver is one of the most important glands of the\n",
      "body, as well as the largest. Because of its physiological influence over\n",
      "the functions of the kidneys, intestines, and body in general and the\n",
      "varied functions that it possesses, it is frequently affected by functional\n",
      "disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the blood that comes directly from the intestine is received by the\n",
      "liver. It secretes the bile, neutralizes many of the poisonous substances\n",
      "and end products of digestion that are taken up by the absorbing vessels of\n",
      "the intestine, and acts as a storehouse for the glycogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be readily understood from this brief statement of the nature of the\n",
      "liver functions, that any functional disorder of the liver may be far\n",
      "reaching in its effect. In many of the diseases that involve other organs,\n",
      "the liver may be primarily affected. It is difficult to diagnose functional\n",
      "disorders of the liver that are responsible for a diseased condition of\n",
      "some other body organ. A knowledge of the physiology and pathology of the\n",
      "liver is of the greatest importance in the diagnosis of this class of\n",
      "disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the larger domestic animals, symptoms of liver diseases are more obscure\n",
      "than in the small animals. In certain parasitic diseases and in mixed and\n",
      "specific infectious diseases, the liver may show marked pathological\n",
      "changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "COMMON CAUSES OF LIVER DISORDERS.--Domestic animals commonly live under\n",
      "very unnatural conditions. Ill results do not follow unless these\n",
      "conditions are so extreme as to violate practically all of the health laws.\n",
      "Pampered animals are especially prone to liver disorders. The feeding of\n",
      "too heavy and too concentrated a ration together with insufficient exercise\n",
      "is one of the most common causes of disorders of the liver. The feeding of\n",
      "a ration that is unsuitable for that particular species is a common source\n",
      "of disease in animals. For example, the feeding to carnivora of a ration\n",
      "made up largely of starchy feed, and the feeding of a ration containing an\n",
      "excessive quantity of protein to herbivorous animals may result in\n",
      "intestinal, liver and nervous disorders. Spoiled feed may prove highly\n",
      "injurious. Catarrhal inflammation of the intestine and intestinal parasites\n",
      "may obstruct the bile duct, and interfere seriously with the functions of\n",
      "the liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Symptoms_.--In diseases of the liver the appetite is irregular or the\n",
      "animal refuses to eat, is constipated, or has diarrhoea. The faeces may be\n",
      "grayish colored or foul smelling. Colicky pains are sometimes manifested.\n",
      "Usually the animal acts dull and weak. A raise in body temperature may be\n",
      "noted. The visible mucous membranes may appear yellowish- or brownish-red in\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The urinary apparatus is composed of two glands, the\n",
      "kidneys and an excretory apparatus that carries the excretion of the\n",
      "kidneys to the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kidneys are situated in the superior region of the abdominal cavity\n",
      "(sublumbar) above the peritoneum, and to the right and left of the median\n",
      "line. They are highly vascular glands, somewhat bean-shaped and of a deep\n",
      "red color. These glands are capable of removing from the blood a fluid that\n",
      "is essentially different in composition and which, if retained in the\n",
      "blood, would be harmful or poisonous to the body tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kidney excretions are carried from the pelvis of the kidneys by the\n",
      "right and left ureters. These canals terminate in the bladder, an\n",
      "oval-shaped reservoir for the urine. This organ is situated in the\n",
      "posterior portion of the abdominal cavity and at the entrance to the pelvic\n",
      "cavity. Posteriorly, it forms a constricted portion or neck. It is here\n",
      "that the urethra originates. This canal represents the last division of the\n",
      "excretory apparatus. In the female, the urethra is short and terminates in\n",
      "the vulva. In the male it is long and is supported by the penis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The urine secreted by the kidneys is a body excretion, and consists of\n",
      "water, organic matter and salts. The nitrogenous end-products, aromatic\n",
      "compounds, coloring matter, and mucin form the organic matter. The\n",
      "nitrogenous end-products and aromatic compounds are urea, uric and hippuric\n",
      "acids, benzoic acid and ethereal sulfates of phenol and cresol. The salts\n",
      "are sulfates, phosphates and chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and\n",
      "magnesium. The organic and inorganic matter varies with the ration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quantity of urine secreted within a given time varies in the different\n",
      "species and at different times in the same individual. In the horse the\n",
      "quantity secreted in twenty-four hours varies from twelve to fifteen pints;\n",
      "in cattle from ten to forty pints; in sheep from one-half to one and\n",
      "three-quarter pints. The normal color of the urine varies. In the horse it\n",
      "is yellow or yellowish-red; in cattle and sheep yellowish; and in the dog a\n",
      "straw yellow. The specific gravity varies with the quantity secreted and\n",
      "the ration fed. When the quantity of urine secreted is above the average,\n",
      "the specific gravity is usually low.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE NECESSITY OF EXAMINING THE URINE.--In diseases of the urinary\n",
      "apparatus, a careful examination of the urine is very necessary in order to\n",
      "be able to form a correct diagnosis. In domestic animals it is impractical\n",
      "to attempt to determine the exact amount of urine passed within a certain\n",
      "time, but we can make a general estimate of the quantity passed by\n",
      "carefully observing the animal and noting the condition of the bedding in\n",
      "the stall. The sample of urine to be examined is best taken from urine\n",
      "collected at different periods during the day. We should note its color and\n",
      "consistency. The different substances in the urine can be determined only\n",
      "by determining the specific gravity, testing with certain chemical reagents\n",
      "and by making a microscopic examination of the sediment. Normal urine from\n",
      "the horse may be turbid or cloudy and more or less slimy, because of the\n",
      "presence of mucin. This is less true of other species. In disease the color\n",
      "of the urine may be changed to a pale yellow, red or brown. For example, in\n",
      "congestion of the kidneys the urine is light in color and rather\n",
      "transparent; in southern cattle fever it may be red; and in azoturia it may\n",
      "be brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXCESSIVE URINATION.--The horse is the most common sufferer from excessive\n",
      "secretion of urine. The most common _causes_ are musty feeds, such as hay,\n",
      "grain and shipped feeds. New oats, succulent feeds and acrid plants may\n",
      "sometimes cause it. In the fall of the year, when the season is changing\n",
      "from warm to cool weather and the horse eliminates less water from the body\n",
      "by way of the skin, the kidneys may become more active and the quantity of\n",
      "urine secreted be greatly increased. This, however, is a normal\n",
      "physiological condition and should not be confused with this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first _symptom_ noted is the frequent passing of a large quantity of\n",
      "urine. The animal drinks more water than usual and the appetite is poor.\n",
      "Dulness and a weak, emaciated condition are prominent symptoms. Death\n",
      "occurs unless the cause of the disease is removed. If the poisonous\n",
      "substance has been acting for some time, it is difficult to cure the\n",
      "animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This disease can be _prevented_ by eliminating spoiled feeds from the\n",
      "ration fed to animals in our care. Early in the attack the necessary\n",
      "attention to the ration and the feeding of a clean, nourishing ration is\n",
      "sufficient to correct the disease. The quantity of water drunk by the\n",
      "animal should be limited. Complete rest is indicated. Laxatives, stimulants\n",
      "and tonics should be given if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEPHRITIS.--Congestion and inflammation of the kidneys commonly occur in\n",
      "mixed and specific infectious diseases, such as septicaemia, pyaemia and\n",
      "influenza. The toxic effect of spoiled feeds, impure drinking water, and\n",
      "irritating drugs like cantharides and turpentine may so irritate the\n",
      "kidneys as to cause them to become inflamed. Chilling of the skin and\n",
      "nervousness or extreme fear may sometimes cause a congestion of these\n",
      "organs. Inflammation of the kidneys is a common complication of azoturia.\n",
      "Irritation from parasites should be included among the causes of this\n",
      "disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _symptoms_ vary in the different stages of the disease. During the\n",
      "period of active congestion the quantity of urine secreted is increased.\n",
      "The scant secretion of urine, dark in color and thick or turbid, is\n",
      "suggestive of an inflammation of the kidneys. The animal moves stiffly, the\n",
      "back may be arched, urination is painful and the urine is passed in very\n",
      "small amounts. The appetite is irregular or suppressed, the pulse strong at\n",
      "first but later small and weak, and the body temperature is elevated. On\n",
      "making a rectal examination we find the bladder empty and the kidneys\n",
      "enlarged and sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the kidneys become so badly diseased that they can no longer perform\n",
      "their function of separating from the blood the nitrogenous end-products of\n",
      "digestion, uraemic poisoning occurs. In this later stage of the disease the\n",
      "animal staggers about if moved, and finally goes down in the stall and is\n",
      "unable to get up. Death is usually preceded by convulsions and coma.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The prognosis_ is very unfavorable, death occurring in the majority of\n",
      "cases. In azoturia of horses and in infectious diseases, the inflammation\n",
      "is nearly always acute. The color of the urine, its high specific gravity\n",
      "and the small quantity passed are valuable symptoms to consider in the\n",
      "recognition of this disease. Chronic inflammation generally develops slowly\n",
      "and may not give rise to any very prominent symptoms at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ of nephritis consists in careful nursing of\n",
      "animals affected with acute infectious diseases, a clean water supply and\n",
      "avoiding the feeding of spoiled feeds. The _curative treatment_ is largely\n",
      "careful nursing. The animal should be given comfortable, well-ventilated\n",
      "quarters and complete rest. Chilling of the skin should be especially\n",
      "guarded against by protecting the body with heavy blankets and applying\n",
      "roller bandages to the limbs when necessary. The diet must be of such a\n",
      "nature as not to increase the work of the kidneys. For the first few days\n",
      "the animal should receive very little feed or water. Later a sloppy diet of\n",
      "sweet milk, green feed and mashes should be fed. Such purgatives as aloes\n",
      "and Glauber's salts are indicated at a very early stage in the disease. We\n",
      "must encourage the elimination of waste products by way of the skin in the\n",
      "larger animals by vigorous rubbing, blanketing and the administration of\n",
      "such drugs as pilocarpine. If the animal becomes weak, general and heart\n",
      "tonics may be given.\n",
      "\n",
      "CYSTITIS.--Inflammation of the bladder is not an uncommon disease of\n",
      "horses. It is commonly _caused_ by retention of the urine, calculi in the\n",
      "bladder and chilling of the body. Irritating drugs that are eliminated from\n",
      "the body in the urine, and infection of the bladder by germs may cause it.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are usually marked. The inflammation is characterized by\n",
      "more or less pain, depending on the degree of the inflammation, and\n",
      "frequent passing of urine. Only a small amount of urine is passed at each\n",
      "attempt, and in severe inflammation it may contain pus or blood. Colicky\n",
      "pains sometimes occur. The pain is usually manifested by a stiff,\n",
      "straddling gait and tenderness when pressure on the bladder is made by\n",
      "introducing the hand into the rectum or vagina, and pressing over the\n",
      "region of the bladder. General symptoms, such as elevation in body\n",
      "temperature and irregular appetite, may be manifested.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ should be first directed at removing the cause. If a cystic\n",
      "calculus is present in the bladder it should be removed. If the retention\n",
      "of the urine is caused by some local condition, and this is very often the\n",
      "case in nervous, well-bred animals, this must first be corrected. It is\n",
      "best to feed green and soft feeds, such as bran mash and chopped hay, and,\n",
      "if the animal will take them, gruels. A physic of castor or linseed oil\n",
      "should be given occasionally. It is very necessary that the animal be kept\n",
      "quiet. Comfortable, clean quarters and a good bed should be provided.\n",
      "Whenever necessary the animal should be blanketed. The medicinal treatment\n",
      "consists in irrigating the bladder with antiseptic solutions, and\n",
      "administering drugs that when eliminated by way of the urine may change its\n",
      "composition and render it less irritating. The following mixture may be\n",
      "given: potassium chlorate two ounces, salol one-half ounce, and powdered\n",
      "nux vomica one ounce. This mixture may be divided into sixteen powders. One\n",
      "of the powders should be given with each feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "RETENTION OF THE URINE.--This may be due to a variety of _causes_. In the\n",
      "ox and ram, small calculi collect in the S-shaped curvature of the urethra,\n",
      "or at its terminal extremity. In the horse, cystic calculi are more common\n",
      "than urethral. In cattle and hogs, fatty secretions from the inflamed\n",
      "lining membrane of the sheath of the male may accumulate, and obstruct the\n",
      "flow of urine from the anterior opening. The giving of feed rich in salts,\n",
      "concentrated urine resulting from feeding of too dry a ration, insufficient\n",
      "exercise and inflammation of the bladder are the direct causes of calculi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compression of the urethra by growths or tumors, strictures of the urethra,\n",
      "distended bladder, spasm of the neck of the bladder in nervous animals,\n",
      "paralysis of the bladder and injuries to the penis are common causes of\n",
      "retention of the urine.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The early symptoms in ruminants_ are not usually recognized until a day or\n",
      "two after retention of the urine has occurred. The symptoms are then quite\n",
      "marked. The animal acts dull, refuses to eat, rumination is stopped, and\n",
      "there is a constant effort to urinate, as indicated by the raising of the\n",
      "tail and rhythmical contractions of the urinary muscles just below the\n",
      "anus. Urine may dribble from the sheath or the flow may be completely\n",
      "suppressed. The odor of urine may be marked.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Horses show symptoms_ of abdominal pain. The animal may move about the\n",
      "stall, lie down and get up again, or make unsuccessful attempts to urinate.\n",
      "On examination the bladder is found to be greatly distended with urine. In\n",
      "the horse the retention is recognized at an earlier period than in\n",
      "ruminants, because of the prompt, decided symptom of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retention of the urine commonly terminates in rupture of the bladder in\n",
      "ruminants. When this occurs, the symptoms of pain are less evident. Death\n",
      "occurs from uraemic poisoning and peritonitis. The outcome is less\n",
      "favorable in ruminants than in solipeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Inflammation of the sheath_ can be readily recognized because of the local\n",
      "swelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The following lines of treatment_ are recommended: A ration or feed that\n",
      "favors the formation of calculi should not be fed to animals; inflammation\n",
      "of the sheath should receive prompt treatment--this consists in irrigating\n",
      "the part with warm, soapy or alkaline water, followed by an antiseptic\n",
      "wash; we may attempt to work the urethral calculi forward and out of the\n",
      "S-curve in the urethra; if this is unsuccessful, urethrotomy for their\n",
      "removal may be attempted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retention of the urine in horses, because of spasm or paralysis of\n",
      "certain muscles, may be treated by passing the catheter. Sometimes\n",
      "spreading litter under the horse and keeping it quiet may induce it to\n",
      "urinate. Hot packs over the region of the back may be used. The treatment\n",
      "for calculi is entirely surgical. The operation for the removal of cystic\n",

      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The study of the organs concerned with the\n",
      "reproduction of the species is essential in order to acquire a knowledge of\n",
      "their several functions. It is only through an understanding of these\n",
      "functions that we can prepare ourselves to correctly recognize, and\n",
      "successfully treat, or prevent, such diseases as may involve the organs of\n",
      "generation. A knowledge of the structure and function of the generative\n",
      "organs of the female is of greater importance from the standpoint of\n",
      "disease, than is a similar knowledge of the generative organs of the male.\n",
      "The female is concerned with the complete reproductive process, which may\n",
      "be divided into four stages. These are _copulation_, _fecundation_,\n",
      "_gestation_ and _parturition_. The male is concerned only with _copulation_\n",
      "and _fertilization_ of the ovum by the spermatozoa, while the female must\n",
      "protect and nourish the embryo and foetus until it has become sufficiently\n",
      "developed to live independently of the protection and nourishment afforded\n",
      "it within the womb. When the final stage of gestation is reached, birth or\n",
      "the act of parturition occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "GENITAL ORGANS OF THE FEMALE.--The female generative organs are the\n",
      "ovaries, fallopian tubules, uterus, vagina, vulva and mammary glands.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The ovaries_ are analogous to the testicles of the male. Their function is\n",
      "to secrete ova. This pair of glands is suspended from the superior region\n",
      "(sublumbar) of the abdominal cavity by folds of the lining membrane.\n",
      "Leading from the ovaries, but connected with the surface of these glands\n",
      "only during the period of oestrum or heat, are the fallopian tubules. Their\n",
      "function is to carry the ovum from the ovaries to the uterus.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The uterus or womb_ is a membranous sack situated in the sublumbar region\n",
      "and at the inlet to the pelvic cavity. It is held in position by numerous\n",
      "folds of the lining membrane of the abdominal cavity. We may divide the\n",
      "womb into three divisions, cornua, body and cervix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cornua or horns are long and cylindrical in shape. This portion of the\n",
      "womb is greatly developed in animals, like the sow and bitch, that give\n",
      "birth to several young. In the impregnated animal the wall of the cornua\n",
      "that contains one or several foetuses, and the body as well, becomes\n",
      "greatly thickened and the lining membrane more vascular.\n",
      "\n",
      "The body is short in all domestic animals and connects the horns with the\n",
      "cervix or neck. The latter is represented by a narrow portion that projects\n",
      "backward into the vagina. In the cow the cervix is less prominent than in\n",
      "the mare and the tissue that forms it, quite firm. In the cow the opening\n",
      "in the cervix, the os, is very small.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The vagina_ is a musculo-membranous canal that leads from the womb. In the\n",
      "mare and cow it is about one foot in length. Its function is to take part\n",
      "in copulation and parturition.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The vulva_ is the external opening of the maternal passages. It shows a\n",
      "vertical slit enclosed by lips, and interiorly it forms a passage that is\n",
      "continuous with the vagina. This passage is about six inches long in the\n",
      "larger animals. The different features that should be noted are the\n",
      "clitoris, a small erectile organ located at the inferior portion of the\n",
      "opening, the meatus urinaris, the external opening of the urethra, situated\n",
      "in a depression in the floor of the vulva, and the hymen, an incomplete\n",
      "membranous partition that may be found separating the vulva from the\n",
      "vagina.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The mammary glands or udders_ secrete the milk that nourishes the young.\n",
      "The glands vary in number. The mare has two, the cow four (Fig. 17), the\n",
      "ewe two and animals that give birth to several young, eight or more. Each\n",
      "gland is surmounted by a teat or nipple. The glandular tissue consists of\n",
      "caecal vesicles that form grape-like clusters around the milk tubules. The\n",
      "milk tubules from the different portions of the gland converge and form\n",
      "larger tubules that finally empty into small sinuses or reservoirs at the\n",
      "base of the teat. Leading from these sinuses are one or several milk ducts\n",
      "that open at the summit of the teat.\n",
      "\n",
      "GENITAL ORGANS OF THE MALE.--The genital organs of the male are the\n",
      "testicles, the ducts or canals leading from the testicles, the seminal\n",

      "\n",
      "Lying along the superior border of the testicle is a mass of ducts, the\n",

      "STERILITY, IMPOTENCY.--Fecundation does not always follow intercourse of\n",
      "the male and female. Impotency in the male and sterility in the female\n",
      "frequently occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ are quite varied. A normal copulation may be impossible\n",
      "because of injuries to, and deformities of, the parts and tumor growths.\n",
      "Deformed genital organs and obstructions of the os by growths and scar\n",
      "tissue are causes of sterility in the female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Failure to breed is commonly caused by faulty methods of feeding and care.\n",
      "Over-feeding and insufficient exercise may result in the body tissues\n",
      "becoming loaded with fat. This may cause a temporary sterility, but if\n",
      "persisted in, as is frequently the case in show animals, the sterility\n",
      "becomes permanent because of the genital glands failing to secrete ova and\n",
      "spermatozoa, or the lack of vitality of the male and female elements. Old\n",
      "age and debility from disease or poor care may induce loss of sexual desire\n",
      "and an absence of, or weakened spermatozoa in, the seminal fluid. The\n",
      "refusal of the male to serve certain females is sometimes noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuberculosis may affect the ovaries and cause permanent sterility. In\n",
      "inflammation of the lining membrane of the womb and vagina, the secretions\n",
      "are abnormal and may collect in the womb and the passages leading to it.\n",
      "These secretions destroy the vitality of the spermatozoa, and this\n",
      "condition may be considered a common cause of sterility in the larger\n",
      "animals. Many vigorous young males are made impotent by excessive\n",
      "copulation. The excessive use of the male at any time may result in failure\n",
      "to impregnate a large percentage of the females that he serves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barren females do not become pregnant after frequent intercourse with the\n",
      "male. Young sterile females may not come in heat. Sometimes unnatural\n",
      "periods of heat are manifested, the animal coming in heat frequently or\n",
      "remaining in heat for a longer period than usual. This sometimes occurs in\n",
      "tuberculosis of the ovaries. In chronic inflammation of the maternal\n",
      "passage there is more or less discharge from the vulva. Both sexes may be\n",
      "overly fat or weakened and debilitated by disease. Deformity of the\n",
      "generative organs and growths may be found on making an examination.\n",

      "_The treatment_ is largely preventive. It is very important that breeding\n",
      "animals be kept in proper physical condition by avoiding the feeding of too\n",
      "heavy or too light a ration, and allowing them sufficient exercise. The\n",
      "male is more often affected by the latter cause than the female. This is\n",
      "because the average stockman does not consider exercise given under the\n",
      "right conditions an important factor in maintaining the vigor of the male.\n",
      "Young males should not be given excessive intercourse with the female. Such\n",

      "Chronic inflammation of the maternal passages should be treated by\n",
      "irrigating the parts with a one per cent warm water solution of lysol, or\n",
      "liquor cresolis compound. The parts should be irrigated daily for as long a\n",
      "period as necessary. Fat animals should be subjected to a rigid diet and\n",
      "given plenty of exercise. Following this treatment a stimulating ration may\n",
      "be fed for the purpose of encouraging the sexual desire. In weak and\n",
      "debilitated animals, the cause should first be removed and a proper ration\n",

      "SIGNS OF PREGNANCY.--The signs which characterize pregnancy are numerous\n",
      "and varied. For convenience we may classify the many signs of pregnancy\n",
      "under two heads, probable and positive. Under the head of probable signs,\n",
      "we may group the following symptoms of pregnancy: cessation of heat;\n",
      "changes in the animal's disposition; increase in the volume of the abdomen\n",
      "and tendency to put on fat. The positive signs are the change in the volume\n",
      "of the udder; the secretion of milk; the movement of the foetus and\n",
      "presence of the foetus in the womb, as determined by rectal examination or\n",
      "by the feel of the abdomen.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The probable signs_ are not reliable, and should be considered only in\n",
      "connection with some positive sign. Persons who base their opinion of the\n",
      "condition of an animal that is supposed to be pregnant on probable signs,\n",
      "are frequently mistaken. It has frequently happened that animals whose\n",
      "condition was not at all certain have given birth to young, without giving\n",
      "rise to what may be termed characteristic probable signs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest probable symptom is the cessation of heat. In the large\n",
      "pregnant animals, irregular heat periods may occur, but in the majority of\n",
      "cases we may safely consider the animal impregnated if several heat periods\n",
      "are passed over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been generally observed that the disposition of the pregnant animal\n",
      "is changed. They become more quiet and less nervous and irritable. The\n",
      "tendency of pregnant animals to put on fat is frequently taken advantage of\n",
      "by the stockman, who may allow the boar to run with the herd during the\n",
      "latter period of fattening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The increase in the volume of the abdomen may be considered a _positive_\n",
      "sign of pregnancy in the small animals, but in the mare and cow it can not\n",
      "be depended on. Animals that are pregnant for the first time, do not show\n",
      "as great an increase in the volume of the abdomen as do animals that have\n",
      "gone through successive pregnant periods. The volume of the abdomen may\n",
      "vary greatly in the different individuals, and can not be depended on as a\n",
      "positive indication of pregnancy during the first two-thirds of the period\n",
      "of pregnancy in the larger domestic animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparatively early in pregnancy, the presence of a foetus can be\n",
      "determined by feeling the uterus through the wall of the rectum. In the\n",
      "small domestic animals the feeling of the abdomen gives the best results.\n",
      "In the cow this method of diagnosis is practised during the latter periods\n",
      "of pregnancy. The examiner stands with his back toward the animal's head,\n",
      "and on the right side of the cow and the left side of the mare. The palm of\n",
      "the hand is applied against the abdominal wall, about eight or ten inches\n",
      "in front of the stifle and just below the flank. Moderate pressure is used,\n",
      "and if a hard, voluminous mass is felt, or if the foetus moves, it is a\n",
      "sure sign that the animal is pregnant. It is not uncommon for the foetus to\n",
      "show some movement in the morning, or after the animal drinks freely of\n",
      "cold water. The increase in the volume of the udder occurs at a\n",
      "comparatively early period in animals that are pregnant for the first time.\n",
      "The secretion of milk and the dropping of the muscles of the quarters\n",

      "where the animals have access to clean water and the necessary shelter,\n",
      "seldom suffer from an abnormal birth. Here they live under the most\n",
      "favorable conditions for taking exercise, securing a suitable diet and\n",
      "avoiding injury. It may not be possible in managing breeding animals to\n",
      "provide such surroundings at all times, but we should observe every\n",
      "possible hygienic precaution, especially if the animal has reached the\n",
      "later periods of pregnancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "All pregnant animals are inclined to be lazy, but, if permitted, will take\n",
      "the necessary exercise. Pregnant mares are usually worked. Such exercise\n",
      "does no harm, providing the work is not hard or of an unusual character.\n",
      "Cows are usually subject to more natural conditions than other domestic\n",
      "animals.\n",

      "Protecting pregnant animals against injuries resulting from crowding,\n",

      "crowding together in the sleeping quarters and about feeding-troughs, or\n",
      "through doors and climbing over low partitions are common causes of injury\n",
      "in pregnant sows. Crowding together in the stable or yard, or through\n",
      "doorways, fighting, and slipping on floors, or icy places sometimes results\n",
      "in injury. It is rare, however, for cows to abort from an injury, but\n",
      "parturition may not be completely free from disagreeable complications.\n",
      "Under the conditions mentioned retention of the fetal membranes is common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ewes frequently suffer from too close confinement during late winter. Sows\n",
      "are often subject to the most unhygienic conditions. This is shown in the\n",
      "heavy death-rate in sows and pigs. During the late winter and early spring\n",
      "the conditions may be such as not to permit of exercise. Stormy, snowy,\n",
      "muddy weather is common at this season of the year. Persons caring for ewes\n",
      "and sows should see that they take sufficient exercise. It may be necessary\n",
      "to drive them about for a short time each day. At such times it may be\n",
      "advisable to give them a laxative dose of oil, or give a laxative with the\n",
      "feed. When there is any indication of constipation, this should be\n",
      "practised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pregnant animals should be fed carefully. We may feed animals that are not\n",
      "in this condition in a careless fashion, but if pregnant, over-feeding, the\n",
      "feeding of a fattening ration, or spoiled feed, and sudden changes in the\n",
      "feed can not be practised with any degree of safety. A bulky ration of dry\n",

      "At the end of the parturition period, separate quarters should be provided.\n",
      "The mare or cow should be given a comfortable clean stall away from the\n",
      "other animals. The ewe should be provided with a warm room if the weather\n",
      "is cold. It is always best to give the sow a separate pen that is dry and\n",

      "ABORTION.--The expulsion of the foetus at any time during the period of\n",
      "gestation, when it is not sufficiently developed to live independently of\n",
      "the mother, is termed abortion. Abortion may be either _accidental_ or\n",
      "_infectious_. Accidental abortion is more commonly met with in the mare and\n",
      "sow than the infectious form. In ruminants the opposite holds true.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes of accidental abortion_ are faulty methods of feeding and care.\n",
      "Injuries, acute indigestion, mouldy, spoiled feeds, chilling resulting from\n",
      "exposure and drinking ice-cold water, nervousness brought on by fright, or\n",
      "excitement and general diseases are the common causes of abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Infectious abortion_ is most common in cows. Other domestic animals that\n",
      "may be affected are the mare, sow and ewe.\n",
      "\n",
      "_It is caused_ by a specific germ. The _Bacillus abortus_ of Bang is the\n",
      "cause of abortion in cows, but the specific germ that produces abortion in\n",
      "other species of animals has not been proven. In this country, Keer, Good,\n",
      "Giltner and others have proven that the Bang bacillus of abortion is\n",
      "infectious for other species of animals, and outbreaks of this disease have\n",
      "been said to occur among breeding ewes pastured and fed on infected\n",
      "premises. Its infectiousness for the females of other species has never\n",
      "been proven in natural outbreaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disease-producing germs are present in the body of the foetus, the\n",
      "fetal membranes, the discharge from the maternal passages, the faeces and\n",
      "milk of aborting animals. The male may carry the infection in the sheath,\n",
      "urethra and on the penis. The natural avenues of infection are the maternal\n",

      "It is very seldom that abortion is carried from one herd to another by\n",
      "means other than through the breeding of animals free from abortion to\n",
      "animals affected by this disease. The purchase of a bull or cow from an\n",
      "infected herd and breeding them to animals that are free from disease, is a\n",
      "common method of spreading the disease. After serving the diseased animal,\n",
      "the male may carry the bacillus of abortion into the maternal passages of\n",
      "the next cow he serves. There are numerous cases on record where the bull\n",
      "was a permanent carrier of the Bacillus abortus and infected nearly every\n",
      "animal served. The distribution of the disease in the herd following the\n",
      "introduction of a cow, sow, or ewe that has aborted before or after being\n",
      "purchased, takes place through contact of the other animals with the virus\n",
      "that may be present on the floor, or in the manure, or by taking the virus\n",
      "into the digestive tract along with the feed and drinking water.\n",
      "Experimental evidence indicates the latter avenue of infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stallion is the most common source of infectious abortion in mares. An\n",
      "infected stallion may distribute the disease to a large percentage of the\n",
      "mares that he serves. For this reason nearly all of the mares in a certain\n",
      "locality may abort.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case the infection occurs at the time of service, the abortion usually\n",
      "takes place during the first half of the period of pregnancy. Cows that\n",
      "become pregnant without recovering from the inflammation of the lining\n",
      "membrane of the genital tract, may abort at a very early period. McFadyean\n",
      "and Stockman from the artificially inoculated cases of infectious abortion\n",
      "in cows, showed that the period of incubation averaged 126 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms of accidental abortion_ are extremely variable. Animals that\n",
      "abort during the early periods of pregnancy may show so little disturbance,\n",
      "that the animal can be treated as if nothing had happened. During the\n",
      "latter half of pregnancy, and especially when the accident is caused by an\n",
      "injury, the symptoms are more serious. Loss of appetite, dulness,\n",
      "restlessness, abdominal pain and haemorrhage are the symptoms commonly\n",
      "noted. If the foetus is dead, it may be necessary to assist the animal in\n",
      "expelling it. In the latter case, death of the mother may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight falling of the flanks, swelling of the lips of the vulva and a\n",
      "retention of the fetal membranes, or discharge from the vulva may be the\n",
      "only symptoms noted at the time abortion occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms of infectious abortion_ vary in the different periods of\n",
      "pregnancy. At an early period, the foetus may be passed with so little\n",
      "evidence of labor that the animal pays little attention to it. The\n",
      "recurrence of heat may be the first intimation of the abortion. All cases\n",
      "of abortion are followed by more or less discharge from the vulva. This is\n",
      "especially true if the fetal membranes are retained. In such cases, the\n",
      "discharge has a very disagreeable odor. In most cases the foetus is dead.\n",
      "When born alive, it is weak and puny, and usually dies or is destroyed\n",
      "within a few days. When the attendant fails to give the animal the\n",
      "necessary attention, or is careless in his manipulation of the parts,\n",
      "inflammation of the womb, caused by the decomposition of the retained\n",
      "membranes, or the introduction of irritating germs on the ropes,\n",
      "instruments and hands, may occur. Death commonly follows this complication.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very important that the infectious form be diagnosed early in the\n",
      "outbreak. For all practical purposes we are justified in diagnosing\n",
      "infectious abortion, if several animals in the herd abort, especially if it\n",
      "follows the introduction of new animals. Methods of serum diagnosis, the\n",
      "agglutination and complement-fixation tests, are now used in the diagnosis\n",
      "of this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ of the accidental form consists in avoiding\n",
      "conditions that may result in this accident. Pregnant animals should not be\n",
      "exposed to injuries from other animals or from the surroundings. Animals\n",
      "which show a predisposition to abort should not be bred. We should see that\n",
      "all animals receive the necessary exercise and a proper ration.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the animal indicates by her actions that abortion may take place, we\n",
      "should give her comfortable, quiet quarters. It is very necessary to keep\n",
      "her quiet, and if restless, morphine may be given. A very light diet should\n",
      "be fed and constipation prevented by administering a laxative. The\n",
      "necessary attention should be given in case abortion occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enforcement of _preventive_ or _quarantine measures_ is very important\n",
      "in the control of infectious abortion. This is especially true of breeding\n",
      "herds and dairy cows. Breeders do not recognize the importance of keeping\n",
      "their herds clean or free from disease. It is a well-known fact among\n",
      "stockmen that abortion and other infectious diseases have been frequently\n",
      "introduced into the herd through the purchase of one or more breeding\n",
      "animals. Because of the prevalence of infectious abortion among cows, it is\n",
      "advisable to subject newly purchased breeding animals, or a cow that has\n",
      "been bred outside of the herd, to a short quarantine period before allowing\n",
      "them to mix with the herd. The breeding of cows from neighboring herds to\n",
      "the herd bull is not a safe practice. In communities where there are\n",
      "outbreaks of this disease, animals that abort, or show indications of\n",
      "aborting, should be quarantined for a period of from two to three months.\n",
      "The separation from the herd should be so complete as to eliminate any\n",
      "danger of carrying the disease to the healthy animals on the clothing and\n",
      "farm tools. If this method of control were practised at the very beginning\n",
      "of the outbreaks, the disease could be checked in the large majority of\n",
      "herds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foetus and membranes should be destroyed by burning. In case the animal\n",
      "does not pass the fetal membranes, they should be completely removed. In\n",
      "the cow, it is advisable to wait twenty-four hours before doing this. The\n",
      "animal's stall should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. It is very\n",
      "advisable to give the entire stable a thorough disinfecting. For this\n",
      "purpose a three or four per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compound\n",
      "may be used. It is advisable to apply it with a spray pump. The floor and\n",
      "feed troughs should be sprinkled daily with the disinfectant. All manure\n",
      "should be removed to a place where the animals can not come in contact with\n",
      "it. It is not advisable to confine the cows to a small yard. The more range\n",
      "they have the easier it is to control the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Individual treatment_ is very necessary. In infectious abortion the mucous\n",
      "lining of the womb and the passages leading to it become inflamed. This\n",
      "should be treated by irrigating the parts with a warm water solution of a\n",
      "disinfectant that is non-irritating. This treatment should be repeated\n",
      "daily for a period of from two to four weeks. We must be very careful not\n",

      "PHYSIOLOGY OF PARTURITION.--Parturition or birth, when occurring in the\n",
      "mare, is designated as foaling; in the cow, calving; in the sheep, lambing;\n",
      "and in the sow, farrowing. A normal or natural birth occurs when no\n",
      "complications are present and the mother needs no assistance. When the act\n",
      "is complicated and prolonged, it is termed abnormal birth. The length of\n",
      "time required for different individuals of the same species to give birth\n",
      "to their young varies widely. It may require but a few minutes, or be\n",
      "prolonged for a day or more. The cause of this variation in the length of\n",
      "time required for different animals to bring forth their young, can be\n",
      "better understood if we study the anatomy of the parts and their functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the pregnant period the _expulsion of the foetus_ is being\n",
      "prepared for. As the foetus develops there is a corresponding development\n",
      "of the muscular wall of the womb. The last period of pregnancy is\n",
      "characterized by the relaxation of the muscles and ligaments that form the\n",
      "pelvic walls, and a relaxation and dilation of the maternal passages. In\n",
      "addition, degenerative changes occur in the structures that attach the\n",
      "foetus to the womb, the normal structures being gradually destroyed by a\n",
      "fatty degeneration. This results in a separation between the fetal and\n",
      "maternal placenta. The contents of the womb begin to affect the organ in\n",
      "the same manner as a foreign body, irritating the nerve endings and\n",
      "producing contractions of the muscles. These contractions of the muscles\n",
      "help greatly in breaking down the attachments until finally the labor pains\n",
      "begin in earnest, and the foetus is gradually forced out of the womb,\n",
      "through the dilated os and into the vagina and vulva.\n",
      "\n",
      "_A normal birth_ is possible, only when the expelling power of the womb is\n",

      "walls are formed by bones and ligaments that are covered by heavy muscles.\n",
      "As previously mentioned, the ligaments and muscles relax toward the end of\n",
      "pregnancy in order to prepare the way for the passage of the foetus. Before\n",
      "entering the pelvis it is necessary for the foetus to be forced through the\n",
      "inlet to this cavity. This is the most difficult part of the birth, as the\n",
      "bones that form the framework of the pelvis completely enclose the entrance\n",
      "to it. It is only in the young mother that the pelvic bones give way\n",
      "slightly to the pressure on them by the foetus. It can be readily\n",
      "understood, that when the young is large in proportion to the diameter of\n",
      "the pelvic inlet, it is difficult for it to pass through. This occurs when\n",
      "mothers belonging to a small breed, are impregnated by a sire belonging to\n",
      "a large breed of animals. It may also occur if the mother is fed too\n",
      "fattening a ration and not permitted sufficient exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The part of the foetus that presents itself for entrance into the pelvic\n",
      "cavity and its position are of the greatest importance in giving birth to\n",
      "the young. Either end of the foetus, or its middle portion may be presented\n",
      "for entrance. The _anterior_ and _posterior presentations_ may be modified\n",
      "by the position that the foetus assumes. It may be in a position that\n",
      "places the back or vertebrae opposite the upper portion of the inlet, or\n",
      "the floor or sides of the pelvic cavity. These positions may be modified by\n",
      "the position of one or both limbs, or the head and neck being directed\n",
      "forwards instead of backwards. In the _transverse presentations_, the back,\n",
      "or the feet and abdomen of the foetus may present themselves for entrance\n",
      "to the pelvic cavity. These presentations may show three positions each.\n",
      "The head may be opposite the upper walls of the inlet, the foetus assuming\n",
      "a dog-sitting position, or it may lie on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to overcome the friction between the foetus and the wall of the\n",
      "maternal passages, these parts are lubricated by the fluids that escape\n",
      "from the \"water bags.\" If birth is prolonged and the passages become dry,\n",
      "birth is retarded. The hair offers some resistance in a posterior\n",
      "presentation. Young mares that become hysterical have abnormal labor pains\n",
      "that seem to hold the foetus in the womb instead of expelling it.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARE OF THE MOTHER AND YOUNG.--Although birth is generally easy in the\n",
      "different domestic animals, it may be difficult and complicated, and it is\n",
      "of the greatest economic importance that special attention be given the\n",
      "mother at this time. It is very necessary for her to be free if confined in\n",
      "a stall. If running in a pasture or lot, the necessary shelter from storms,\n",
      "cold or extreme heat should be provided. Other farm animals, such as hogs,\n",
      "horses and cattle, should not be allowed to run in the same lot or pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "When parturition commences, the mother should be kept under close\n",
      "observation. If the labor is difficult and prolonged, we may then examine\n",
      "the parts and determine the cause of the abnormal birth. Unnecessary\n",
      "meddling is not advisable. Before attempting this examination, the hands\n",
      "should be cleaned and disinfected, and the finger nails shortened if\n",
      "necessary. The different conditions to be determined are the nature of the\n",
      "labor pains, the condition of the maternal passages, and the position and\n",
      "presentation of the foetus. In the smaller animals this examination may be\n",
      "difficult. In prolonged labor the parts may be found dry and the labor\n",
      "pains violent and irregular, or weak. The foetus may be jammed tightly into\n",
      "the pelvic inlet, it may be well forward in the womb, the head and fore or\n",
      "hind limbs may be directed backwards, or one or more of these parts may be\n",
      "directed forward in such a position as to prevent the entrance of the\n",
      "foetus into the pelvic inlet. Sometimes the foetus is in a transverse\n",
      "position. The parts that present themselves at the pelvic inlet should be\n",
      "carefully examined and their position determined. The necessary assistance\n",
      "should then be given. Any delay in assisting in the birth may result in the\n",
      "death of the young or mother, or both. On the other hand, unintelligent\n",
      "meddling may aggravate the case and render treatment difficult or\n",
      "impossible. There is no line of veterinary work that requires the attention\n",
      "of a skilled veterinarian more than assisting an irregular or abnormal\n",
      "birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attendant must guard against infecting the parts with irritating germs,\n",
      "or irritating and injuring them in any way. The hands, instruments, and\n",
      "cords must be freed from germs by washing with a disinfectant, or\n",
      "sterilization with heat. The quarters must be clean in order to prevent\n",
      "contamination of the instruments and clothing of the attendant by filth.\n",
      "Extreme force is injurious. For illustration, we may take a case of\n",
      "difficult birth caused by an unusually large foetus. Both presentation and\n",
      "position are normal, the forefeet and head having entered the pelvic\n",
      "cavity, but the shoulders and chest are jammed tightly in the inlet, and\n",
      "the progress of the foetus along the maternal passages is retarded. By\n",
      "using sufficient force, we may succeed in delivering the young, but by\n",
      "pulling on one limb until the shoulder has entered the pelvis, and\n",
      "repeating this with the opposite limb we are able to deliver the young\n",
      "without exposing the mother to injury. It may be necessary to change an\n",
      "abnormal presentation, or position, to a normal presentation, or as nearly\n",
      "normal as possible. This should be done before any attempt is made to\n",
      "remove the foetus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following birth the mother should not be unnecessarily disturbed. The\n",
      "quarters should be clean, well bedded and ventilated, but free from\n",
      "draughts. If the parturition has been normal, a small quantity of easily\n",
      "digested feed may be fed. If weak and feverish, feed should be withheld for\n",
      "at least twelve hours. The mare should be rested for a few weeks. The young\n",
      "needs no special attention if it is strong and vigorous, but if weak, it\n",
      "may be necessary to support it while nursing, or milk the mother and feed\n",
      "it by hand. If the mother is nervous and irritable, it may be necessary to\n",
      "remove the young temporarily to a place where she can hear and see it,\n",
      "until a time when she can be induced to care for it. The principal\n",
      "attention required for young pigs is protection against being crushed by\n",
      "the mother. The cutting off and ligation of the umbilical cord at a point a\n",
      "few inches from the abdomen, and applying tincture of iodine or any\n",
      "reliable disinfectant is very advisable in the colt and calf.\n",
      "\n",
      "RETENTION OF THE FETAL MEMBRANES.--The foetus is enveloped by several\n",
      "layers of membranes. The _external envelope, the chorion_, is exactly\n",
      "adapted to the uterus. The _innermost envelope, the amnion_, encloses the\n",
      "foetus. Covering the external face of the amnion and lining the inner face\n",
      "of the chorion is a double membrane, _the allantois_. The envelopes\n",
      "mentioned are not the only protection that the foetus has against injury.\n",
      "It is enveloped in fluids as well. Immediately surrounding it is the\n",
      "_liquor amnii_, and within allantois is the _allantoic fluid._\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Placenta of cow.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The placenta_ is a highly vascular structure spread out or scattered over\n",
      "the surface of the chorion and the mucous membrane of the uterus, that\n",
      "attaches the foetus and its envelopes to the womb (Fig. 19). It is by means\n",
      "of this vascular apparatus that the foetus is furnished with nourishment.\n",
      "The fetal and maternal placentas are made up of vascular villi and\n",
      "depressions that are separated only by the thin walls of capillaries, and a\n",
      "layer of epithelial cells. This permits a change of material between the\n",
      "fetal and maternal circulation. The arrangement of the placenta differs in\n",
      "the different species. In the mare and sow, the villi are diffused. In\n",
      "ruminants, the villi are grouped at certain points. These vascular masses\n",
      "are termed cotyledons. The maternal cotyledons or \"buttons\" form appendages\n",
      "or thickened points that become greatly enlarged in the pregnant animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward the end of the pregnant period, the attachments between the fetal\n",
      "and maternal placentulae undergo a fatty degeneration and finally separate.\n",
      "This results in contractions of the muscular wall of the uterus, and the\n",
      "expulsion of the foetus and its envelopes. In the mare, it is not uncommon\n",
      "for the colt to be born with the covering intact. This does not occur in\n",
      "the cow. Usually the envelopes are not expelled until a short time after\n",
      "birth in all animals, and it is not uncommon for them to be retained. This\n",
      "complication is most commonly met with in the cow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mare the _retention of the fetal envelopes_ or \"afterbirth\" is\n",
      "commonly due to the muscles of the womb not contracting properly following\n",
      "birth. Abortion, especially the infectious form, is commonly complicated by\n",
      "a retention of the fetal membranes. Any condition that may produce an\n",
      "inflammation of the lining membrane of the womb may result in retention of\n",
      "the \"after-birth.\" Injuries to the uterus resulting from the animal\n",
      "slipping, fighting and becoming crowded are, no doubt, common causes of\n",
      "failure to \"clean\" in cows.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are so marked that a mistaken diagnosis is seldom made. A\n",
      "portion of the membranes is usually seen hanging from the vulva, and the\n",
      "tail and hind parts may be more or less soiled. The latter symptom is\n",
      "especially prominent if the membranes have been retained for several days,\n",
      "and decomposition has begun. In such case, the discharge from the vulva is\n",
      "dark in color, contains small pieces of the decomposed membrane and has a\n",
      "very disagreeable odor. In the mare, acute inflammation of the womb may\n",
      "result if the removal of the \"after-birth\" is neglected. Loss of appetite,\n",
      "abnormal body temperature, weakness and diarrhoea may follow. Such cases\n",
      "usually terminate in death. Retention of the fetal membranes is a very\n",
      "common cause of leucorrhoea.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in removing the fetal envelopes before there is\n",
      "any opportunity for them to undergo decomposition. In the mare, this should\n",
      "be practised within a few hours after birth has occurred, and in other\n",
      "animals, from one to forty-eight hours. In warm stables and during the warm\n",
      "weather, treatment should not be postponed later than twenty-four hours.\n",
      "The only successful method of treatment is to introduce the hand and arm\n",
      "into the uterus, and break down the attachments with the fingers. In the\n",
      "larger animals, the use of the arm must not be interfered with by clothing.\n",
      "Every possible precaution should be taken to prevent infection of the\n",
      "genital organs with irritating germs. It is advisable in most cases to\n",
      "flush out the womb with a one per cent water solution of liquor cresolis\n",
      "compound after the removal of the fetal envelopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEUCORRHOEA.--This is a chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane lining\n",
      "the genital tract, that is associated with more or less of a discharge from\n",
      "the vulva. It is common in animals that abort, or retain the \"after-birth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The discharge may be white, sticky, albuminous, and without odor, or it may\n",
      "be chocolate colored and foul smelling. The tail and hind parts are usually\n",
      "soiled with it. In chronic inflammation of the womb the discharge is\n",
      "intermittent. In mild cases the health of the animal is in no way impaired.\n",

      "cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Treatment_.--Mild cases readily yield to treatment. This consists in\n",
      "irrigating the maternal passages with a one-half per cent warm water\n",

      "daily and continued for as long a time as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAMMITIS.--Inflammation of the mammary gland or udder is more common in the\n",
      "cow than in any of the other domestic animals. In all animals it is most\n",
      "frequently met with during the first few weeks after birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "_A predisposing cause_ in the development of mammitis is a high development\n",
      "of the mammary glands. The following _direct causes_ may be mentioned:\n",
      "incomplete milking, or milking at irregular intervals; injury to the udder\n",
      "by stepping on the teat; blows from the horns and pressure caused by lying\n",
      "on a rough, uneven surface; chilling of the udder by draughts and lying on\n",
      "frozen ground; and infection of the glandular tissue by _irritating germs_.\n",
      "The latter cause produces the most serious, and, sometimes, a very\n",
      "extensive inflammation. This form of inflammation may spread from one cow\n",
      "to another, causing the milk to be unfit for food, and bringing about the\n",
      "loss of one or more quarters of the udder.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ occurring in the different forms of mammitis differ. The\n",
      "inflammation may involve one or more of the glands, and may affect either\n",
      "the glandular or the connective tissue. In some cases the gland may appear\n",
      "congested for a few days before the inflammatory changes occur. The part\n",
      "becomes hot, swollen, tender and reddened. It may feel doughy or hard. If\n",
      "the connective tissue is involved (interstitial form), there is apt to be a\n",
      "high body temperature, the udder may be much larger than normal, is tender\n",
      "and pits on pressure. Loss of appetite usually accompanies this form of\n",
      "mammitis. Very little or no milk is secreted. Sometimes, the milk is\n",
      "greatly changed in appearance, is foul smelling and contains pus. In\n",
      "congestion of the udder and rupture of the capillary vessels, the milk may\n",
      "contain blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mild inflammation of the udder responds readily to treatment. The\n",
      "interstitial form may terminate in abscesses and gangrene. The replacement\n",
      "of the glandular tissue by fibrous tissue in one or more quarters is not\n",
      "uncommon. Death seldom occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions that may favor\n",
      "or cause an inflammation of the gland. Animals that have highly developed\n",
      "mammary glands should be fed a light diet just before and following\n",
      "parturition. Following parturition, a dose of Epsom or Glauber's salts may\n",
      "be given. If the young does not take all the milk, the udder should be\n",
      "milked out as clean as possible. Massaging the udder by kneading or\n",
      "stroking may be practised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _treatment_ is recommended: The application of a thick\n",
      "coating of antiphlogistin once or twice daily is a useful remedy. If the\n",
      "udder becomes badly swollen, it should be supported with a bandage.\n",
      "Extensive inflammation may be treated by the application of cold in the\n",
      "form of packs of cracked ice. Irrigating the gland with a four per cent\n",
      "water solution of boric acid is an important treatment for certain forms of\n",
      "mammitis. Abscess formation or suppuration should be promptly treated by\n",
      "opening and treating the abscesses. If gangrene occurs, it may be necessary\n",
      "to remove a part, or the whole of the udder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The giving of milk discolored with blood may be treated by applying\n",
      "camphorated ointment twice daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "SORE AND WARTY TEATS.--Irritation to the teats by filth, cold, moisture and\n",
      "injuries cause the skin to become inflamed, sore and scabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Preventive treatment_ is the most satisfactory. Sore teats may be treated\n",
      "by applying the following ointment after each milking: vaseline ten parts\n",
      "and oxide of zinc one part. Pendulous warts may be clipped off with a sharp\n",
      "pair of scissors. Castor oil applied to the wart daily by rubbing may be\n",
      "used for the removal of flat warts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"MILK-FEVER\" OR POST-PARTUM PARALYSIS.--This is a disease peculiar to cows,\n",
      "especially heavy milkers that are in good condition. It most commonly\n",
      "occurs after the third, fourth and fifth calving. The disease usually\n",
      "appears within the first two or three days after calving, but it has been\n",
      "known to occur before, and as late as several weeks after calving. The\n",
      "cause is not certainly known. The Schmidt theory is that certain toxins are\n",
      "formed in the udder, owing to the over activity of the cells of the\n",
      "glandular tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 20.--A case of milk-fever.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are characteristic of the disease. At the very beginning of\n",
      "the attack the cow stops eating and ruminating, becomes uneasy, switches\n",
      "the tail, stamps the feet, trembles, staggers when forced to walk and\n",
      "finally falls and is unable to get up. At first she may lie in a natural\n",
      "position; later, as the paralytic symptoms become more pronounced, the head\n",
      "is laid against the side of the body and the animal seems to be in a deep\n",
      "sleep (Fig. 20). In the more severe form the cow lies on her side,\n",
      "consciousness is lost and the paralysis of the muscles is marked. The\n",
      "different body functions are interfered with; the urine is retained,\n",
      "bloating occurs, respirations are slow, pulse weak and temperature\n",
      "subnormal or normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Preventive treatment_, such as feeding a spare diet during the latter\n",
      "period of pregnancy, is not always advisable. Heavy milkers should be given\n",
      "one-half pound of Glauber's salts a day or two before calving, and the dose\n",
      "repeated when the cow becomes fresh. Cows affected with milk-fever seldom\n",
      "die if treated promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _treatment_ consists in emptying the udder by milking and injecting air\n",
      "or oxygen gas into the gland until it is completely distended (Fig. 21).\n",
      "The milk-fever apparatus should be clean, and the air injected filtered.\n",
      "Before introducing the milking tube into the milk duct, the udder should\n",
      "first be washed with a disinfectant, and a clean towel laid on the floor\n",
      "for the gland to rest on. After injecting the quarter, strips of muslin or\n",
      "tape should be tied around the ends of the teats to prevent the escape of\n",

      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The respiratory apparatus may be divided into two\n",
      "groups of organs, anterior and posterior. The anterior group, the\n",
      "_nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx_ and _trachea_, is situated in\n",
      "the region of the head and neck. The posterior group, the _bronchial tubes_\n",
      "and _lungs_, is situated in the chest or thoracic cavity.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The nostrils_ are the anterior openings of the air passages. The nasal\n",
      "cavities are situated in the anterior region of the head, and extend the\n",
      "entire length of the face. Each cavity is divided into three long, narrow\n",
      "passages by the two pairs of turbinated bones. The lining membrane is the\n",
      "nasal mucous membrane, the lower two-thirds or respiratory portion\n",
      "differing from the upper one-third, in that the latter possesses the nerve\n",
      "endings of the olfactory nerve and is the seat of smell. The five pairs of\n",
      "head sinuses communicate with the nasal cavities. Posteriorly and near the\n",
      "superior extremity of the nasal passages, are two large openings, the\n",
      "guttural, that open into the pharyngeal cavity.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The pharynx_ is a somewhat funnel-shaped cavity. The walls are thin and\n",
      "formed by muscles and mucous membrane. This is the cross-road between the\n",
      "digestive and respiratory passages. In the posterior portion of the cavity\n",
      "there are two openings. The inferior opening leads to the larynx and the\n",
      "superior one to the oesophagus. All feed on its way to the stomach must\n",
      "pass over the opening into the larynx. It is impossible, however, for the\n",
      "feed to enter this opening, unless accidentally when the animal coughs. The\n",
      "cartilage closing this opening is pressed shut by the base of the tongue\n",
      "when the bolus of feed is passed back and into the oesophageal opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The larynx_ may be compared to a box open at both ends. The several\n",
      "cartilages that form it are united by ligaments. It is lined by a mucous\n",
      "membrane. The posterior extremity is united to the first cartilaginous ring\n",
      "of the trachea. The anterior opening is closed by the epiglottis. Just\n",
      "within is a V-shaped opening that is limited laterally by the folds of the\n",
      "laryngeal mucous membrane, the vocal chords.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The trachea_ is a cylindrical tube originating at the posterior extremity\n",
      "of the larynx, and terminating within the chest cavity at a point just\n",
      "above the heart in the right and left bronchial tubes. It is formed by a\n",
      "series of cartilaginous rings joined together at their borders by ligaments\n",
      "and lined by a mucous membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The bronchial tubes_ resemble the trachea in structure. They enter the\n",
      "lungs a short distance from their origin, where they subdivide into\n",
      "branches and sub-branches, gradually decreasing in calibre and losing the\n",
      "cartilaginous rings, ligaments and muscular layer until only the thin\n",
      "mucous membrane is left. They become capillary in diameter, and finally\n",
      "open into the infundibula of the air cells of the lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The lungs_ take up all of the space in the thoracic cavity not occupied by\n",
      "the heart, blood-vessels and oesophagus. This cavity resembles a cone in\n",
      "shape that is cut obliquely downwards and forward at its base. The base is\n",
      "formed by the diaphragm which is pushed forward at its middle. It is lined\n",
      "by the pleura, a serous membrane, that is inflected from the wall over the\n",
      "different organs within the cavity. The median folds of the pleura divide\n",
      "the cavity into right and left portions. A second method of describing the\n",
      "arrangement of the pleura is to state that it forms two sacks, right and\n",
      "left, that enclose the lungs. The lungs are the essential organs of\n",
      "respiration. The tissue that forms them is light, will float in water, is\n",
      "elastic and somewhat rose-colored. Each lung is divided into lobes, and\n",
      "each lobe into a great number of lobules by the supporting connective\n",
      "tissue. The lobule is the smallest division of the lung and is formed by\n",
      "capillary bronchial tubes, air cells and blood-vessels. It is here that the\n",
      "external respiration or the exchange of gases between the capillaries and\n",
      "the air cells occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "VENTILATION.--It is agreed by all persons who have investigated the\n",
      "subject, that unventilated stable air is injurious to animals. At one time\n",
      "it was believed that the injurious effects resulting from the breathing of\n",
      "air charged with gases and moisture from the expired air and the animal's\n",
      "surroundings, were due to a deficiency in oxygen. It is now believed that\n",
      "the ill-effects are mainly due to the stagnation of air, the humid\n",
      "atmosphere, and the irritating gases emanating from the body excretions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common impurities found in _stable air_ are carbonic and ammonia gas,\n",
      "moisture charged with injurious matter and dust from the floor and bodies\n",
      "of the animals. As a rule, the more crowded and filthy the stable, the more\n",
      "impurities there are in the air. If any of the animals are affected with an\n",
      "infectious disease, such as tuberculosis or glanders, the moisture and dust\n",
      "may act as carriers of the disease-producing germs. Infectious diseases\n",
      "spread rapidly in crowded, poorly ventilated stables. The two factors\n",
      "responsible for this rapid spread of disease are the lowered vitality of\n",
      "the animal, due to breathing the vitiated air, and the greater opportunity\n",
      "for infection, because of the comparatively large number of bacteria\n",
      "present in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The purpose of stable ventilation_ is to replace the stable air with purer\n",
      "air. The frequency with which the air in the stable should be changed\n",
      "depends on the cubic feet of air space provided for each animal, and the\n",
      "sanitary conditions present. The principal factor in stable ventilation is\n",
      "the force of the wind. In cold weather it is very difficult to properly\n",
      "ventilate a crowded stable without too much loss of animal heat and\n",
      "creating draughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For practical purposes, the _need of ventilation_ in a stable can be\n",
      "determined by the odor of the air, the amount of moisture present and the\n",
      "temperature. It is impossible to keep the air within the stable as pure as\n",
      "the atmosphere outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "All dangers from injury by breathing impure air, or by draughts can be\n",
      "eliminated by proper stable construction, attention to the ventilation and\n",
      "keeping the quarters clean.\n",

      "\n",
      "CATARRH (COLD IN THE HEAD).--Catarrh is an inflammation of the mucous\n",
      "membrane lining the nasal cavities that usually extends to the membrane\n",
      "lining of the sinuses of the head. It may be acute or chronic. The\n",
      "inflammation very often extends to the pharynx and larynx. Cold in the head\n",
      "is more common in the horse than in any of the other animals (Fig. 22).\n",
      "\n",
      "_The most common causes_ of \"colds\" are standing or lying in a draught,\n",
      "becoming wet, and exposure to the cold. \"Colds\" are common during cold,\n",
      "changeable weather. Horses that are accustomed to warm stables, are very\n",
      "apt to take \"cold\" if changed to a cold stable and not protected with a\n",
      "blanket. Most animals are not affected by the cold weather if given dry\n",
      "quarters and a dry bed. Irritation to the mucous membrane by dust, gases\n",
      "and germs is a common cause. Influenza and colt distemper are characterized\n",
      "by an inflammation of the respiratory mucous membranes. In the horse,\n",
      "chronic catarrh is commonly caused by diseased teeth, and injuries to the\n",
      "wall of the maxillary sinus. In sheep, the larvae of the bot-fly may cause\n",
      "catarrh.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The early symptoms_ usually pass unnoticed by the attendant. The lining\n",
      "membrane of the nostrils is at first dry and red. During this stage\n",
      "sneezing is common. In a few days a discharge appears. This is watery at\n",
      "first, but may become catarrhal, heavy, mucous-like and turbid. In severe\n",
      "cases it resembles pus. The lining membrane of the eyelids appears red and\n",
      "tears may flow from the eye. Sometimes the animal acts dull and feverish,\n",
      "but this symptom does not last longer than one or two days unless\n",
      "complicated by sore throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Inflammation of the throat_ is a common complication of \"colds.\" It is\n",
      "characterized by difficulty in swallowing and partial, or complete loss of\n",
      "appetite. Drinking or exercising causes the animal to cough. If the larynx\n",
      "as well as the pharynx is inflamed, distressed and noisy breathing may\n",
      "occur. Pressure over the region of the throat causes the animal pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common \"cold\" terminates favorably within a week. Chronic catarrh may\n",
      "persist until the cause is removed and the necessary local treatment\n",
      "applied. Inflammation of the pharynx and larynx may persist for several\n",
      "weeks unless properly treated. Abscesses may form in the region of the\n",
      "throat. Horses frequently become thick winded as a result of severe attacks\n",
      "of sore throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. \"Colds\" and sore throat\n",
      "can be largely prevented by good care, exercise and properly ventilated\n",
      "stables. Mild cases require a light diet, comfortable quarters and a dry\n",
      "bed. Allowing the animal to inhale steam three or four times daily is\n",
      "useful in relieving the inflammation. Easily digested feeds, and in case\n",
      "the animal has difficulty in swallowing, soft feeds and gruels, should be\n",
      "given. The throat may be kept covered with a layer of antiphlogistin and\n",
      "bandaged. Glycoheroin may be given in from teaspoonful to tablespoonful\n",
      "doses, depending on the size of the animal. Chlorate of potassium may be\n",
      "given in the drinking water.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the animal becomes run down in flesh, as sometimes occurs in chronic\n",
      "catarrh, bitter tonics should be given. In the latter disease, it is\n",
      "sometimes necessary to trephine and wash out the sinus or sinuses affected\n",
      "with an antiseptic solution. It may be necessary to continue this treatment\n",
      "for several weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "BRONCHITIS.--Inflammation of the bronchial tubes may be either acute or\n",
      "chronic. Acute bronchitis is especially common in the horse, while the\n",
      "chronic form is more often met with in the smaller animals, especially\n",
      "hogs. This disease is most common among horses during the changeable\n",
      "seasons of the years. It is _caused_ by warm, close stables or stalls, and\n",
      "irritating gases emanating from the floor, or manure in the stall. In\n",
      "general, the causes are about the same as in cold in the head. In young\n",
      "animals and hogs, the inhalation of dust, and bronchial and lung worms\n",
      "commonly cause it. Verminous bronchitis usually becomes chronic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_In the acute form_ of the disease the _symptoms_ come on very quickly, the\n",
      "fever is high and the pulse beats and respirations are rapid. Chilling of\n",
      "the body occurs, and the animal may appear dull and refuse to eat. The\n",
      "animal coughs frequently. Recovery occurs within a few days, unless\n",
      "complicated by sore throat and pneumonia. In the horse, bronchitis is not a\n",
      "serious disease, but in other animals recovery is delayed and complications\n",
      "are more common.\n",
      "\n",
      "_In chronic bronchitis_ in the horse, the animal coughs frequently, there\n",
      "is more or less discharge from the nostrils and the respirations may become\n",
      "labored when exercised. The animal is usually weak, in poor flesh and unfit\n",
      "for work. In other cases, symptoms of broken wind are noticed. Severe\n",
      "coughing spells on getting up from the bed, or on moving about are\n",
      "characteristic of bronchitis in hogs. Verminous bronchitis in calves and\n",
      "lambs is characterized by severe spells of coughing, difficult and labored\n",
      "breathing and a weak, emaciated condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ is the same as for \"colds.\" In the acute form\n",
      "the treatment consists largely in careful nursing. Properly ventilated,\n",
      "clean quarters that are free from dust should be provided. The animal\n",
      "should be covered with a light or heavy blanket, depending on the\n",
      "temperature of the stable, and the limbs bandaged. A light diet should be\n",
      "fed for a few days. It is advisable to give the animal a physic of oil. The\n",
      "inhalation of steam every few hours during the first few days should be\n",
      "practised. Glycoheroin may be given three or four times a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animals affected with chronic bronchitis should not be exercised or worked.\n",
      "We should guard against their taking cold, give nourishing feeds, and a\n",
      "tonic if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.--Pulmonary congestion is generally due to\n",
      "overexertion and exposure to extreme heat or cold. It may occur if the\n",
      "animal is exercised when sick or exhausted. Hogs that are heated from\n",
      "exercise and allowed access to cold water, may suffer from a congestion or\n",
      "engorgement of the lungs. It may be present at the beginning of an attack\n",
      "of pneumonia or pleurisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are difficult breathing and the animal fights for its\n",
      "breath. The body temperature may be several degrees above the normal. In\n",
      "the mild form, the above symptoms are not so marked. The onset and course\n",
      "of the disease are rapid, recovery, pneumonia, or death often occurring\n",
      "within twenty-four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Pulmonary haemorrhage_ is not uncommon. The discharge from the nostrils\n",
      "may be slightly tinged with blood, or there may be an intermittent\n",
      "discharge of blood from the nostrils or mouth. The mucous membranes are\n",
      "pale, the animal trembles and shows marked dyspnoea.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in using the proper judgment in caring\n",
      "for, and in working or exercising animals. This is especially true if the\n",
      "animal is affected with acute or chronic disease. At the very beginning,\n",
      "bleeding should be practised. Hot blankets renewed frequently and bandages\n",
      "to the limbs is a very necessary part of the treatment. In case of severe\n",
      "pulmonary haemorrhage, treatment is of little use.\n",
      "\n",
      "PNEUMONIA.--Inflammation of the lungs is more common in horses than in any\n",
      "of the other domestic animals. The croupous form is the most common. The\n",
      "inflammation may affect one or both lungs, one or more lobes, or scattered\n",
      "lobules of lung tissue. The inflammation may be acute, subacute or chronic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ are very much the same as in other respiratory diseases.\n",
      "Exposure to cold and wet, stable draughts, becoming chilled after\n",
      "perspiring freely and washing the animal with cold water are the common\n",
      "causes of pneumonia. Inflammation of the lungs is especially apt to occur\n",
      "if the animal is not accustomed to such exposure. Animals affected with\n",
      "other respiratory diseases are predisposed to pneumonia. Drenching animals\n",
      "by way of the nostril and irritating drenches, or regurgitated feed passing\n",
      "into the air passages and lungs are the traumatic causes of pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different forms of pneumonia. In case pneumonia\n",
      "occurs secondarily, the earliest symptoms are confounded with those of the\n",
      "primary disease. The first symptoms noticed may be a high body temperature,\n",
      "as indicated by chills, and refusing to eat. The visible mucous membranes\n",
      "are red and congested, the nostrils dilated, the respirations quickened and\n",
      "difficult, the expired air hot and the pulse beats accelerated. The animal\n",
      "coughs, and in the horse, a rusty discharge may be noticed adhering to the\n",
      "margins of the nostrils. The horse refuses to lie down if both lungs are\n",
      "inflamed. In severe cases the expression of the face indicates pain, the\n",
      "respirations are labored, the general symptoms aggravated, and the animal\n",
      "stands with the front feet spread apart. Cattle are inclined to lie down,\n",
      "unless the lungs are seriously affected. Hogs like to burrow under the\n",
      "litter.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The course of croupous pneumonia_ is typical, and unless it terminates\n",
      "fatally in the first stage, the periods of congestion, hepatization and\n",
      "resolution follow each other in regular manner. Auscultation of the lungs\n",
      "is of great value in diagnosing and watching the progress of the disease.\n",
      "It is more difficult to determine the character of the lung sounds in the\n",
      "horse and cow than it is in the small animals. This is especially difficult\n",
      "if the animal is fat. During the period of _congestion_ which lasts about a\n",
      "day, one can hear both healthy and crepitating sounds. The period of\n",
      "_hepatization_ is characterized by an absence of sound over the diseased\n",
      "area. The inflammatory exudates become organized at the beginning of this\n",
      "stage, and the air can not enter the air cells. This period lasts several\n",
      "days. _Resolution_ marks the beginning of recovery or convalescence. Toward\n",
      "the end of the second period, the inflammatory exudate in the air cells has\n",
      "begun to degenerate. In the last stage, these exudates undergo liquefaction\n",
      "and are absorbed, or expelled by coughing, in from seven days to two weeks,\n",
      "depending on the extent of the inflammation and the general condition of\n",
      "the animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "_In the subacute form_ the symptoms are mild and may subside within a week.\n",
      "Sometimes _abscesses_ form in the lung. _Gangrenous inflammation_ of the\n",
      "lung can be recognized by the odor of the expired air and the severity of\n",
      "the symptoms. This form of pneumonia terminates fatally. If the larger\n",
      "portion of the lung tissue is inflamed, death from asphyxia may occur in\n",
      "the second stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success in the _treatment_ of pneumonia depends largely on the care.\n",
      "Properly ventilated, clean, comfortable quarters and careful nursing are\n",
      "highly important. Large animals should be given a roomy box stall. Cold\n",
      "does not aggravate pneumonia, providing the animal's body is well protected\n",
      "with blankets and the limbs bandaged. Wet, damp quarters and draughts are\n",
      "injurious. Hogs should be given plenty of bedding to burrow in. A light,\n",
      "easily digested diet should be fed. Very little roughage should be fed. If\n",
      "the animal does not eat well, it may be given eggs and milk. Weak pulse\n",
      "beats should be treated by giving digitalis and strychnine.\n",
      "Counterirritation to the chest wall is indicated. During convalescence,\n",
      "bitter tonics may be given. Constipation should be treated by giving the\n",
      "animal castor or linseed oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLEURISY.--Inflammation of the pleura is most common in horses. It occurs\n",
      "in all farm animals and is frequently unilateral. There are two forms of\n",
      "pleurisy, acute and chronic. Pleuropneumonia is common when the cause is a\n",
      "specific germ. This occurs in tuberculosis, pleuropneumonia of horses and\n",
      "pneumococcus infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The common causes_ are exposure to cold, chilling winds, draughty, damp\n",
      "quarters, and drinking cold water when perspiring. Injuries to the costal\n",
      "pleura by fractured ribs and punctured wounds may cause it to become\n",
      "inflamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The early symptoms of acute pleurisy are chills, rise in body temperature,\n",
      "pain and abdominal breathing. The most characteristic symptom is the ridge\n",
      "extending along the lower extremities of the ribs (pleuritic ridge). The\n",
      "animal does not stand still as in pneumonia, but changes its position\n",
      "occasionally, its movements in many cases being accompanied by a grunt.\n",
      "Pressure on the wall of the chest causes the animal to flinch and show\n",
      "evidence of severe pain. Large animals rarely lie down. The cough is short\n",
      "and painful. On placing the ear against the wall of the chest and listening\n",
      "to the respirations, we are able to hear friction sounds. After a few days\n",
      "effusion occurs in the pleural cavity. Although the animal may have refused\n",
      "to eat up to this time, it now appears greatly relieved and may offer to\n",
      "eat its feed. This relief may be only temporary. If the fluid exudate forms\n",
      "in sufficient quantity to cause pressure on the heart and lungs and\n",
      "interfere with their movement, the pulse beat is weak, the respirations\n",
      "quick and labored, the elbows are turned out and the feet are spread apart.\n",
      "All of the respiratory muscles may be used. The expression of the face may\n",
      "indicate threatened asphyxia. We may determine the extent of the pleural\n",
      "exudate by auscultation. There is no evidence of respiratory sounds in that\n",
      "portion of the chest below the surface of the fluid. Dropsical swellings\n",
      "may occur on the under surface of the breast and abdomen.\n",
      "\n",
      "_In subacute cases_ evidence of recovery is noted in from four to ten days.\n",
      "_Acute pleurisy_ very often terminates fatally. Under the most favorable\n",
      "conditions, recovery takes place very slowly, sometimes extending over a\n",
      "period of several months. It is not uncommon for the horse to continue\n",
      "having \"defective wind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in good care, well ventilated quarters and careful\n",
      "nursing, the same as recommended in the treatment of pneumonia. At the very\n",
      "beginning, the pain may be relieved by the administration of small doses of\n",
      "morphine. If the conditions in the stable permit, a hot blanket that has\n",
      "been dipped in hot water and wrung out as dry as possible, may be applied\n",
      "to the chest wall and covered with a rubber blanket. This treatment should\n",
      "be continued during the first few days of the inflammation. These\n",
      "applications may be reinforced by occasionally applying mustard paste to\n",
      "the sides of the chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The animal should be allowed to drink but a limited amount of water. The\n",
      "feed must be highly nutritious. Milk and eggs should be given if necessary.\n",
      "A laxative dose of oil should be given. Calomel, aloes, and digitalis are\n",
      "recommended when the effusion period approaches in order to increase the\n",
      "elimination of fluid, and lessen its entrance into the body cavity. If the\n",
      "amount of effusion is large, puncture of the thoracic cavity with a trocar\n",
      "and cannula may be practised. This operation should be performed carefully,\n",
      "and all possible precautions used against infection of the wound. During\n",
      "the later period of the disease iodide of potassium, iron and bitter tonics\n",
      "should be given.\n",
      "\n",
      "BROKEN-WIND, HEAVES.--The terms broken-wind and heaves are used in a way to\n",
      "include a number of different diseases of the respiratory organs of the\n",
      "horse. The term heaves is applied almost wholly to an emphysematous\n",
      "condition of the lungs. Broken-wind may include the following diseased\n",
      "conditions: obstruction of the nasal passages by bony enlargements and\n",
      "tumors; tumors in the pharynx; enlarged neck glands; collection of pus in\n",
      "the guttural pouches and paralysis of the left, or both recurrent nerves\n",
      "(roaring).\n",
      "\n",
      "_The common causes_ of heaves are pre-existing diseases of the respiratory\n",
      "organs, severe exercise when the animal is not in condition and wrong\n",
      "methods of feeding. Heaves is more common in horses that are fed heavily on\n",
      "dusty timothy and clover hay and allowed to drink large quantities of water\n",
      "after feeding, than in horses that are fed green feeds, graze on pastures\n",
      "or receive prairie hay for roughage. Chronic indigestion seems to aggravate\n",
      "the disease. Over-distention of the stomach and intestines due to feeding\n",
      "too much roughage and grain interferes with respiration. Severe exercise\n",
      "when in this condition may result in over-distention, dilation and rupture\n",
      "of the air cells. This is the most common structural change met with in the\n",
      "lungs of horses affected with heaves. It is termed emphysema.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The common symptoms_ noted are the double contraction of the muscles of\n",
      "the flank with each expiration, a short, dry cough and the dilated\n",
      "nostrils. The frequent passage of gas is a prominent symptom in\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The circulatory organs are the heart, arteries, veins\n",
      "and lymphatics. The _heart_ is the central organ of the circulatory system\n",
      "(Fig. 23). Its function is to force the blood through the blood-vessels. It\n",
      "is situated in the thoracic cavity between the lungs, and enclosed by a\n",
      "special fold of the pleura, the pericardial sack. There are two kinds of\n",
      "blood-vessels, arteries and veins. The _arteries_ leave the heart and carry\n",
      "the blood to the many different organs of the body. The _veins_ return to\n",
      "the heart and carry the blood from the body tissues. The _capillaries_ are\n",
      "small blood-vessels, microscopic in size, that connect the arteries with\n",
      "the veins. The arteries carry the pure blood. The opposite is true,\n",
      "however, of the lesser or pulmonary system. The pulmonary artery carries\n",
      "the impure blood to the lungs, and the pulmonary veins carry the pure blood\n",
      "back from the lungs. The _lymphatic vessels_ carry a transparent or\n",
      "slightly colored fluid and chyle from the tissues and alimentary canal.\n",
      "This system of vessels empties into the venous system.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Photograph of model of horse's heart: auricle;\n",
      "ventricle; pulmonary artery; pulmonary veins; posterior aorta; and anterior\n",
      "aorta.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The functions of the blood_ are to nourish the body tissues; furnish\n",
      "material for the purpose of the body secretions; supply the cells of the\n",
      "body with oxygen; convey from the tissues injurious substances produced by\n",
      "the cellular activity; and destroy organisms that may have entered the body\n",
      "tissues. The cellular and fluid portions of the blood are not always\n",
      "destructive to disease-producing organisms. In certain infectious diseases,\n",
      "the fluid portion of the blood may contain innumerable organisms, and\n",
      "destruction of the blood cells occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_In inflammation_ of tissue the circulation of the blood in the inflamed\n",
      "part undergoes certain characteristic changes. At the beginning there is an\n",
      "increase in the blood going to the part. This is followed by a slowing of\n",
      "the blood stream in the small vessels, and the collecting of the blood\n",
      "cells in the capillaries and veins. These circulatory changes are followed\n",
      "by the migration of the blood cells, and the escape of the fluid portion of\n",
      "the blood into the surrounding tissue. The character of the above\n",
      "circulatory changes depends on the extent of the injury to the tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "PALPITATION.--This disturbance in domestic animals seems to be purely\n",
      "functional. It may occur independent of any organic heart disease. A highly\n",
      "nervous condition, excitement, over-exertion, debility from disease and the\n",
      "feeding of an improper ration are the common causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart beats are so violent and tumultuous as to shake the body, and be\n",
      "noticed when standing near the animal. The heart sounds are louder than\n",
      "normal and the pulse beats small and irregular. It may be differentiated\n",
      "from spasm of the diaphragm by determining the relationship of the heart\n",
      "beats to the abrupt shocks observed in the costal and flank regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in keeping the animal quiet and avoiding any\n",
      "excitement. A quiet stall away from the other animals is best. The\n",
      "treatment of palpitation resulting from some organic heart disease must be\n",
      "directed largely at the original disease. Morphine is commonly used for the\n",
      "treatment of this disorder. Weak, anaemic animals should receive blood and\n",
      "bitter tonics. If we have reason to believe that the disturbance is caused\n",
      "by improper feeding, the animal should receive a spare diet for a few days.\n",
      "In such cases it is advisable to administer a physic.\n",
      "\n",
      "PERICARDITIS.--Inflammation of the pericardial sack is usually a secondary\n",
      "disease. It is frequently met with in influenza, contagious\n",
      "pleuropneumonia, hog-cholera and rheumatism. Cattle may suffer from\n",
      "traumatic pericarditis caused by sharp, pointed, foreign bodies passing\n",
      "through the wall of the reticulum and penetrating the pericardial sack. The\n",
      "jagged ends of fractured ribs may cause extensive injury to neighboring\n",
      "parts, and the inflammation spreads to the pericardial sack.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ of pericarditis may not be recognized at the very beginning\n",
      "when the disease occurs as a complication of influenza, or infectious\n",
      "pleuropneumonia. The manifestation of pain by moving about in the stall,\n",
      "refusing to eat and the anxious expression of the face are the first\n",
      "symptoms that the attendant may notice. The body temperature is higher than\n",
      "normal, and the pulse rapid and irregular. On auscultation, friction sounds\n",
      "that correspond to the tumultuous beats of the heart are heard. When fluid\n",
      "collects within the pericardial sack, the heart beats become feeble and the\n",
      "pulse weak. Labored breathing and bluish discoloration of the lips follow.\n",
      "The disease usually runs a very acute course. The prognosis is unfavorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ recommended in pneumonia is indicated in this disease.\n",
      "Absolute rest and the feeding of an easily digested, laxative diet is a\n",
      "very essential part of the treatment. At the very beginning morphine may be\n",
      "given to quiet the tumultuous beats of the heart. Cold applications to the\n",
      "chest wall in the form of ice packs should be used. Heart tonics and\n",
      "stimulants such as digitalis, strychnine and alcohol should be administered\n",
      "when the pulse beats weaken. To promote absorption of the exudate, iodide\n",
      "of sodium may be given. Mustard paste, or a cantharides blister applied\n",
      "over the region of the heart is useful in easing the pain and overcoming\n",
      "the inflammation. If fluid collects in sufficient quantity to seriously\n",
      "interfere with the heart action, the sack may be punctured with the trocar\n",
      "and cannula and the fluid withdrawn. Great care must be used to avoid\n",
      "injury to the heart and infection of the part.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Elephantiasis in horse.]\n",
      "\n",
      "ACUTE LYMPHANGITIS.--This is an inflammation of the lymphatic vessels of\n",
      "one or both hind limbs. The attack comes on suddenly and usually occurs in\n",
      "connection with rest, and in horses that are of slow, quiet temperament.\n",
      "The _exciting cause_ is an infection of the part with bacteria, the\n",
      "infection probably occurring through some abrasion or small wound in the\n",
      "skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The local symptoms_ are swelling, tenderness and lameness in the affected\n",
      "limb. The animal may refuse to support its weight on the affected limb. The\n",
      "lymphatic glands in the region are swollen, and the swelling of the limb\n",
      "pits on pressure. In the chronic form of the disease, the regions of the\n",
      "cannon and foot remain permanently enlarged, and the swelling is more firm\n",
      "than it is in the acute form (Fig. 24).\n",

      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The nervous system may be divided into central and\n",
      "peripheral portions. The _central portion_ comprises the brain or\n",
      "encephalon and the spinal cord. These organs are lodged in the cranial\n",
      "cavity and spinal canal. The nerves and ganglia comprise the _peripheral\n",
      "portion_. The nerves form white cords that are made up of nerve fibres. The\n",
      "ganglia are grayish enlargements formed by nerve cells and supporting\n",
      "tissue, situated at the origin of the nerve trunk or along its course.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The brain_ is an oval mass of nerve tissue elongated from before to\n",
      "behind, and slightly depressed from above to below. It terminates\n",
      "posteriorly in the spinal cord. It is divided into three portions:\n",
      "_cerebrum, isthmus_ and _cerebellum_ (Fig. 25).\n",
      "\n",
      "_The cerebrum_ forms the anterior portion. It is divided into two lateral\n",
      "lobes or hemispheres by a deep longitudinal fissure. The surface of the\n",
      "cerebral hemispheres is gray and roughened by pleats or folds separated by\n",
      "grooves or fissures. The gray or cortical layer is distinct from the white\n",
      "or connecting structure. The cortical layer is made up of nerve cells or\n",
      "areas which control the voluntary muscles of the body. It is connected with\n",
      "the special senses of touch, temperature and muscle-sense. The gray layer\n",
      "is connected with the posterior portion of the brain, the isthmus or\n",
      "medulla oblongata, by the white nerve tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The isthmus_ or _medulla oblongata_ is elongated from before to behind and\n",
      "connects the cerebral hemispheres with the spinal cord, anteriorly and\n",
      "posteriorly. It is divided into several different portions, and is made up\n",
      "largely of white connecting fibres with nuclei of gray matter scattered\n",
      "through them. The isthmus is hollowed out by a system of small ventricles\n",
      "that extend from the cerebral hemispheres to the spinal cord, where they\n",
      "terminate in a small, central canal. The isthmus is the highway between the\n",
      "spinal cord and the higher nerve centres. It has in it certain cell centres\n",
      "that give origin to six of the cranial nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Photograph of model of horse's brain: longitudinal\n",
      "section; lateral view; cerebrum; cerebellum; and isthmus.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The third division of the brain is the _cerebellum_. This is a single mass\n",
      "supported by the isthmus. It is situated posterior to the cerebrum, from\n",
      "which it is separated by a transverse fold of the membranes covering the\n",
      "brain. This mass of nerve tissue is much smaller than the cerebrum. The\n",
      "white nerve tissue forms central nuclei which send out branches that ramify\n",
      "in every direction. The centre of the muscular sense is said to be located\n",
      "in this division of the brain. A second function is the maintenance of body\n",
      "equilibrium through its connection with the nerve of the middle ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The spinal cord_ commences at the posterior opening (occipital foramen) of\n",
      "the cranial cavity, and terminates posteriorly in the lumbar region at the\n",
      "upper third of that portion of the spinal canal belonging to the sacrum. It\n",
      "is thick, white in color, irregularly cylindrical in shape, slightly\n",
      "flattened above and below and reaches its largest diameter in the lower\n",
      "cervical and lumbar regions. The spinal canal is lined by the outer\n",
      "membrane that envelops the cord, which aids in fixing this organ to the\n",
      "wall of the canal. The spinal cord is formed by white and gray nerve\n",
      "tissue. The gray tissue is situated within the white, and it is arranged in\n",
      "the form of two lateral comma-shaped columns connected by a narrow\n",
      "commissure of gray matter. The extremities of the lateral gray columns mark\n",
      "the origin of the superior and inferior roots of the spinal nerves. The\n",
      "white tissue of the cord is also divided into lateral portions by superior\n",
      "and median fissures. The inferior fissure does not extend as far as the\n",
      "gray commissure, leaving the lateral inferior columns connected by a white\n",
      "commissure. There are certain centres in the spinal cord that are capable\n",
      "of carrying on certain reflex actions independent of the chief centre in\n",
      "the brain. The white matter of the cord is made up of paths over which\n",
      "impulses to and from the brain are transmitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "_There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves_. Two pairs belong exclusively to\n",
      "the special senses, smell and sight. Altogether there are ten pairs that\n",
      "are devoted to functions connected with the head, either as nerves of the\n",
      "special senses or in a motor or sensory capacity (Figs. 26 and 27). There\n",
      "are two pairs distributed to other regions. These are the tenth and\n",
      "eleventh pairs. The tenth pair or pneumogastric is distributed to the vital\n",
      "organs lodged within the body cavities.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are forty-two or forty-three pairs of spinal nerves given off from\n",
      "the spinal cord. The spinal nerves have two roots, superior and inferior.\n",
      "The superior is the sensory root and the inferior is the motor root, both\n",
      "uniting to form a mixed nerve trunk. The sensory root possesses a ganglion\n",
      "from which it originates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, the cerebrospinal system deals with the special senses,\n",
      "movement of skeletal or voluntary muscles and cutaneous and muscular\n",
      "sensations. In addition to the above there is a distinct system termed the\n",
      "sympathetic. The _sympathetic system_ consists of a long cord, studded with\n",
      "ganglia, extending from the base of the neck to the sacrum. The ganglia are\n",
      "connected with the inferior roots of the spinal nerves. This cord is\n",
      "connected with groups of ganglia and nerve fibres in the abdominal region,\n",
      "and this in turn is connected with terminal ganglia in distant tissues.\n",
      "This system of nerves is distributed to the vital organs of the body.\n",

      "CONGESTION AND ANAEMIA OF THE BRAIN.--In congestion of the brain, the\n",
      "blood-vessels distributed to the nerve tissue become engorged with blood.\n",
      "It may be either active or passive.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The cause of anaemia_ of the brain is an insufficient blood supply. This\n",
      "may be due to an abundant haemorrhage and cardiac weakness caused by shock\n",
      "or organic heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes of congestion_ of the brain are faulty methods of care and\n",
      "feeding. It sometimes occurs when horses are shipped in poorly ventilated\n",
      "cars, or kept in close stables. Climatic changes, or changing the stable\n",
      "and feed, may cause it. Extremely fat animals and animals that are rapidly\n",
      "putting on fat are predisposed to this disorder. Improper methods of\n",
      "feeding, lack of exercise, constipation and excitement are the most common\n",
      "causes. Passive congestion may result from pressure on the jugular vein by\n",
      "obstructing the flow of blood from the brain, and raising blood pressure in\n",
      "the blood-vessels of the brain. It is sometimes caused by organic heart\n",
      "trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ come on very suddenly in congestion of the brain. The\n",
      "disease may manifest itself as soon as the animal is moved out of the stall\n",
      "or bed, or it may come on while it is feeding. In slight cases, the animal\n",
      "appears excited and restless, the eyes are bright, the pupils are dilated,\n",
      "and the pulse beats and respirations quickened. If the animal is moving\n",
      "about, it may stop suddenly and show marked symptoms of a nervous disorder,\n",
      "such as turning around, running straight ahead and falling down. The period\n",
      "of excitement is usually brief and may be followed by marked depression.\n",
      "The mucous membranes of the head are a deep, red color.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ in anaemic conditions of the brain are loss of\n",
      "consciousness, stumbling, falling to the ground and sometimes convulsions.\n",
      "The pig and dog may vomit. Favorable cases return to the normal within a\n",
      "few hours. Acute inflammatory diseases of the brain and its coverings are\n",
      "associated with cerebral hyperaemia or congestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ of mild cases is to give the animal quiet, well-ventilated\n",
      "quarters, where it can not injure itself. The animal should be first\n",
      "subjected to a severe diet and later given easily-digested feed. If it\n",
      "appears greatly excited, bleeding should be practised. Cold applications to\n",
      "the head should be used in all cases in the small animals. For internal\n",
      "treatment, purgatives are indicated. In cases of anaemia, stimulants,\n",
      "vigorous massage, artificial respiration and injection of physiological\n",
      "salt solution are indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "SUNSTROKE AND HEATSTROKE.--Most writers make no distinction between\n",
      "heatstroke and sunstroke. The latter is caused by the direct rays of the\n",
      "sun falling on the animal, and the former from a high temperature and poor\n",
      "circulation of air in the surroundings. Under such conditions, the physical\n",
      "condition of the animal and exertion play an important part in the\n",
      "production of the nervous disturbance.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The first symptoms_ usually noted are rapid, labored breathing, depression\n",
      "and an anxious expression on the face. The horse usually stops sweating.\n",
      "The body temperature is extremely high, the pulse beats weak, the animal\n",
      "trembles, falls to the ground and dies in a convulsion. Unless measures\n",
      "directed toward relief of the animal are taken early in the attack, death\n",
      "commonly occurs. Overheating is rather common in horses that are worked\n",
      "hard during the extremely warm weather. Horses that have been once\n",
      "overheated are afterwards unable to stand severe work during the hot months\n",
      "of the year. Horses in this condition become unthrifty, do not sweat freely\n",
      "and pant if the work is hard and the weather is warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive measures_ consist in not exposing animals that are fat, or\n",
      "out of condition to severe exercise if the day is close and hot, especially\n",
      "if they are not accustomed to it. When handling or working animals during\n",
      "hot weather all possible precautions to prevent overheating should be\n",
      "practised.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in placing the animal in a cool, shady place and\n",
      "fomenting the body with cold water. The cold packs or cold fomentations\n",
      "should be applied to the head and forepart of the body only. Small doses of\n",

      "MENINGO-CEREBRITIS.--The discussion of inflammation of the brain and its\n",
      "coverings can be combined conveniently, as the causes, symptoms and\n",
      "treatment vary but little. This disorder is met with in all species of\n",
      "domestic animals, but it is most common in horses and mules. Some writers\n",
      "state that meningo-cerebritis is more common during the warm season than it\n",

      "overexertion, changes in climate, excitement, injuries to the head and the\n",
      "feeding of too heavy and concentrated a ration.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different individuals, but in general they are\n",
      "the same. At first the animal is dull, or extremely nervous and sensitive\n",
      "to sounds. The pupils of the eye are unevenly contracted at first, later\n",
      "dilated. The eyes may appear staring, or they are rolled about, so that the\n",
      "white portion is prominent. The unusual excitement is manifested in\n",
      "different ways by the different species. During the dull period the animal\n",
      "is indifferent to its surroundings. When it is excited, the pulse beats and\n",
      "respirations are accelerated. The body temperature is often elevated early\n",
      "in the disease. There is a partial or complete loss of appetite. Paralysis\n",
      "may be the most prominent symptom. The animal lies in a natural position,\n",
      "or stretched out and lifting the head occasionally and moving the limbs,\n",
      "but it is unable to rise. Loss of sensibility may gradually progress until\n",
      "the animal becomes semiconscious, or comatose.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case the inflammation is acute and involves the greater portion of the\n",
      "brain and its coverings, death occurs within a few days. Occasionally the\n",
      "animal survives several weeks. There are few permanent or complete\n",
      "recoveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The principal lines of treatment_ are preventive measures and careful\n",
      "nursing. This is one of the diseases that can be largely prevented by\n",
      "observing all possible sanitary precautions in caring for animals. It is\n",
      "admitted by writers that the greater majority of cases of inflammation of\n",
      "the brain and its coverings are caused by infection. Proper stable\n",
      "construction, ventilation and disposal of the manure, an occasional\n",
      "disinfection of the stable, cleaning and disinfecting the drinking places\n",
      "and water tanks, and the necessary attention to the ration greatly reduce\n",
      "the loss from this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The animal should be gotten into a dark, quiet, roomy stall that is well\n",
      "bedded. A swing may be placed under a large animal if it is able to support\n",
      "any of its weight, and there is no evidence of nervous excitement. We\n",
      "should do nothing to disturb it. If possible, the position of the animal\n",
      "that is unable to get up should be changed, and the bed kept clean and dry.\n",
      "Cold in the form of wet or ice packs should be applied to the head during\n",
      "the acute stage. Symptoms of excitement must be overcome by large doses of\n",
      "sedatives. Iodide of potassium and strychnine may help in overcoming the\n",
      "paralysis. The bowels should be emptied by giving an occasional physic. A\n",
      "very light, easily digested diet should be fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "PARTIAL OR COMPLETE PARALYSIS OF THE POSTERIOR PORTION OF THE BODY.--This\n",
      "disorder is especially common in the small animals. The hog is most\n",
      "frequently affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The following causes_ may be mentioned: Inflammation of the spinal cord\n",
      "commonly occurs in influenza, strangles and mixed infections; constipation\n",
      "brought on by improper feeding and insufficient exercise is a predisposing\n",
      "cause; injuries such as strains and blows in the region of the back may\n",
      "also cause it; compression of the spinal cord by the vertebrae is no doubt\n",
      "a very common cause; dislocation, enlargement of the disks between the\n",
      "vertebrae, bony enlargements resulting from strains and injuries, rickets,\n",
      "tuberculosis and actinomycosis and tumors commonly cause compression of the\n",
      "cord. It is rarely caused by parasites. Young, fat animals are especially\n",
      "prone to injuries in the region of the back. Such animals may suffer from\n",
      "malnutrition of the bones, and complete fractures of the thigh bones may\n",
      "occur. Extreme heat from the sun's rays and close, hot quarters are\n",
      "probable causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptom_ that is most prominent is the partial or complete loss of\n",
      "control over the movements of the hind parts. The appetite may be little\n",
      "interfered with. The animal may sit on the haunches, with the limbs\n",
      "projecting forward, or swing the hind quarters from side to side in walking\n",
      "or trotting. Irregularity in the animal's movements is especially\n",
      "noticeable when turning or backing. In case the animal suffers pain, the\n",
      "spine is held rigid or arched, and when forced to move, marked evidence of\n",
      "pain occurs. There may be a decrease or increase in the sensibility of the\n",
      "part. The increase in sensibility is noticed on striking the muscles with\n",
      "the hand or rubbing the hair the wrong way. Spasmodic twitching or\n",
      "contractions in the muscles sometimes occur. There is frequent elevation of\n",
      "temperature. The animal is unable to pass urine or faeces, or there may be\n",
      "an involuntary passage of the body excretions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome of this disease is unfavorable. Acute inflammation of the\n",
      "covering of the cord may subside within a few days. Cases that do not\n",
      "recover within a few weeks should be destroyed. Paralysis of the hind parts\n",

      "_The treatment_ is largely along preventive lines. A predisposition toward\n",
      "rickets, and injuries, may be prevented by feeding a proper ration, and\n",
      "permitting the animal to take exercise. The quarters and the attendant are\n",
      "frequently responsible for injuries. If this is the case, the rough\n",
      "handling of the animals should be immediately corrected, and any condition\n",
      "of the quarters that favors the crowding or piling up of animals should be\n",
      "changed. Large animals may be placed in swings if they are able to support\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE SKIN\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The two layers that form the skin are the _epidermis_\n",
      "and the _derma_. The cells of the outer layer or epidermis are of two\n",
      "kinds. The superficial portion is formed by horny, flattened cells and the\n",
      "deeper by softer cells. This layer of the skin varies greatly in thickness\n",
      "in the different species. The derma is composed of some muscular fibres\n",
      "interwoven with the connective-tissue fibres. It contains the roots of the\n",
      "hair follicles, sweat and oil glands. The external face which is covered by\n",
      "the epidermis shows a multitude of little elevations. These are the\n",
      "vascular and nervous papillae. In addition, it shows openings through which\n",
      "the hairs and the skin glands pass. The inner surface is united more or\n",
      "less closely to the muscular or underlying tissue by a layer of fibro-fatty\n",
      "tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The appendages of the skin_ are the hairs and horny productions. The horny\n",
      "productions comprise the horns, chestnuts, ergots, claws and hoofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The hair varies_ in length, thickness and coarseness in the different\n",
      "species, and the different regions of the body. In addition, breeding,\n",
      "care, heat and cold may cause marked variations in the thickness of the\n",
      "coat. Exposure to cold causes the coat to thicken. High temperatures cause\n",
      "the short hairs to drop out and the coat to become thin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diseases of the skin may be _classified as parasitic_ and _non-parasitic_.\n",
      "Parasitic skin diseases are caused by animal and vegetable parasites.\n",
      "Non-parasitic skin diseases are caused by irritation to the skin and\n",
      "internal causes. Irritation to the skin may be either chemical, thermic or\n",
      "mechanical. The internal causes may be due to an individual predisposition\n",
      "together with digestive disturbances and the eating of feeds too rich in\n",
      "protein. In this chapter parasitic skin diseases produced by insects will\n",
      "not be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "FALLING OUT OF THE HAIR AND FEATHERS.--Falling out of the hair and feathers\n",
      "frequently occurs independent of parasitic diseases. This condition does\n",
      "not occur as an independent disorder, but as a secondary affection. It is\n",
      "due to faulty nutrition, and irritation to the skin. Intestinal diseases,\n",
      "insufficient feed and feed of bad quality are common causes. Animals that\n",
      "are fed a heavy ration, or that lie on dirty, wet bedding frequently lose\n",
      "large patches of hair. Sheep that are dipped in late fall and early winter,\n",
      "or exposed to wet, cold weather may lose a part of their fleece. It is not\n",
      "uncommon for animals toward the latter period of pregnancy, or that sweat\n",
      "freely, to lose patches of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling out of the hair heals of itself within a few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive measures_ are of special importance in sheep and horses.\n",
      "This consists in avoiding conditions that may lead to alopecia and in\n",
      "correcting the diet. In horses the regions of the mane and tail should be\n",
      "washed with soap, or rubbed with alcohol and spirits of camphor, equal\n",
      "parts. Treatment should be persisted in for a long period if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "URTICARIA, \"NETTLERASH.\"--Urticaria is characterized by roundish elevations\n",
      "that appear quickly and become scattered over a part or the whole surface\n",
      "of the skin. They are caused by an inflammatory infiltration of the deeper\n",
      "layers of the skin. Horses and hogs are most frequently affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ of urticaria are irritating juices of certain plants,\n",
      "secretions of flies, ants and some caterpillars, irritating drugs,\n",
      "scratching, sweating and the action of cold on a warm skin. It has been\n",
      "observed in connection with the feeding of certain leguminous feeds and\n",
      "digestive disturbances. Horses that are fat, or putting on flesh rapidly,\n",
      "seem to be predisposed to this disorder. Urticaria may occur in certain\n",
      "infectious diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The characteristic symptom_ is the formation on the skin of roundish\n",
      "elevations or \"hives.\" There may be an elevation of body temperature and\n",
      "partial loss of appetite. Small animals may act restless and show evidence\n",
      "of itching or pain. This symptom is very common in hogs. The eruption may\n",
      "last only a few hours or a few days, or, because of the animal's scratching\n",
      "or rubbing the part, the skin may become scabby and small pustules form.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important _preventive measure_ is to avoid the use of agents capable of\n",
      "irritating the skin and producing urticaria when treating parasitic skin\n",
      "diseases. It is very advisable to give the animal a saline cathartic (Epsom\n",
      "or Glauber's salts). The skin may be washed with cold water, or a weak\n",
      "water solution of permanganate of potassium.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACNE, \"SUMMER RASH.\"--In this skin disease the oil glands and hair\n",
      "follicles are inflamed and sometimes infected with pus germs. This results\n",
      "in skin eruptions varying in size from the point of a pin to about a\n",
      "quarter of an inch in diameter. This inflammation is most prominent during\n",
      "the warm weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ are local irritation to the skin from lying on filthy floors,\n",
      "sweating and irritation from the harness. According to some writers, pus\n",
      "germs are the only cause, the mechanical agents merely aiding in the\n",
      "production of the infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The face, side of the neck, shoulders, back and sides of the trunk and\n",
      "quarters are the usual seats of disease. The pimples or nodules may\n",
      "disappear within a few weeks, or persist throughout the warm season. The\n",
      "eruption may disappear without leaving scars, or suppuration occurs and\n",
      "small bald spots result.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in removing the cause of the disease and cleaning\n",
      "the skin with antiseptic washes. The surroundings of the animal must be\n",
      "kept clean and a good bed provided. If possible, the horse should be laid\n",
      "off from work as soon as the condition is noted. Washing the part with a\n",
      "weak water solution of permanganate of potassium may be practised daily.\n",
      "Fowler's solution of arsenic may be given. This may be given with the feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "ECZEMA.--This is an inflammation of the vascular capillary bodies and the\n",
      "superficial layer of the skin. There may be marked inflammatory exudate,\n",
      "causing the surface of the skin to become excessively moist and more or\n",
      "less itching. Redness, vesicles and pustules may characterize the\n",
      "inflammation. In the chronic form the skin may become thickened and greatly\n",
      "changed in structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eczematous inflammation of the skin may occur in all domestic animals, but\n",
      "it is most common in the dog. In the horse local eczema (scratches) is\n",
      "common.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most frequent _cause_ is external irritation. Accumulations of filth on\n",
      "the skin and continual wetting of the part are common causes. Mechanical\n",
      "causes are rubbing, pressure, the action of the sun's rays and chemical\n",
      "irritants. Internal causes, such as catarrhal diseases of the stomach and\n",
      "weakness and emaciation from disease, may act as direct or predisposing\n",
      "causes. Tender-skinned animals seem to be predisposed to the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different species of animals. In the horse the\n",
      "thin skin posterior to the fetlock and knee, in front of the hock and on\n",
      "the under side of the body is most commonly inflamed. Moisture and dirt\n",
      "seem to be the most common causes. Eczema may involve the skin covered by\n",
      "the mane and tail in animals that are not properly groomed and inclined to\n",
      "rub or scratch. Cattle may suffer from eczematous inflammations in the\n",
      "region of the forehead, back of neck and base of tail. A very common form\n",
      "of the disease involves the space between the toes. Sheep frequently suffer\n",
      "from inflammation of the skin over the fetlock region. The skin of animals\n",
      "having long fleeces, or heavy coats of hair that become wet at a time when\n",
      "there is no opportunity to dry out quickly, may become inflamed. Dogs are\n",
      "commonly affected by the acute and chronic forms of eczema. Eczema of swine\n",
      "is limited mostly to young hogs. It is rather rare, excepting in hogs that\n",
      "are pasturing on certain kinds of clover and rape, or on muck lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inflammation is accompanied by a marked tenderness and itching, and the\n",
      "animal licks and scratches the part. This increases the extent of the skin\n",
      "lesions. The skin appears moist, later dirty, scabby and thickened. Cracks\n",
      "and pustules may form. Gangrene and sloughing of the skin may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. Cases of eczema caused by\n",
      "filth and wetness can be prevented by giving the necessary attention to\n",
      "keeping the skin clean and not allowing animals access to muddy, filthy\n",
      "places. Keeping the bed clean and regulating the diet are important\n",
      "preventive measures. Before the inflammation can be successfully treated\n",
      "the cause must be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In acute eczema it is advisable to protect the part against water, filth\n",
      "and air. Powders and ointments may be used during the early stages of the\n",
      "inflammation. Two parts boric acid, four parts flour, and one part tannic\n",
      "acid may be dusted over the moist surface. One part zinc oxide and twelve\n",
      "parts vaseline is a useful ointment. Scratching the part should be\n",
      "controlled in every case by muzzles, collars and bandages. Dirt and scales\n",
      "may be removed from the skin by washing with cotton soaked in lime water or\n",
      "linseed oil. The animal should receive laxative doses of Glauber's salts or\n",
      "oil every few days. A simple, easily digested ration should be fed. The\n",
      "following mixture may be applied in obstinate cases: oil of tar and soft\n",
      "soap, two parts each, and alcohol one part.\n",
      "\n",
      "COMMON FEED RASHES.--This title includes inflammation of the skin caused by\n",
      "pasturing on buckwheat, certain clovers and rape, together with moisture\n",
      "and sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green, flowering buckwheat is more dangerous as a feed for stock than is\n",
      "the grain or straw. Clovers and rape are not as dangerous a feed. The\n",
      "actual cause of the skin becoming inflamed is not known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skin in the regions of the face, ears, neck, lower surface of the body\n",
      "and limbs becomes red and covered with vesicles. Later, scabs and pus may\n",
      "form.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in changing the ration and keeping the animals out\n",
      "of the sun, or long grass and weeds for a few days. This is all the\n",
      "treatment required in most cases. It may be advisable to administer a\n",
      "physic. If pus and scabs form, the part should be cleansed daily with a one\n",
      "per cent water solution of permanganate of potassium.\n",
      "\n",
      "HERPES (FUNGOUS SKIN DISEASE).--This is a contagious disease of the skin\n",
      "caused by thread fungi, _Tricophyton tonsurans_ and _epilans_, which\n",
      "develop in the skin in localized areas, causing vesicles, scabs or scales\n",
      "to appear, and the loss of the hair over the part. This skin disease occurs\n",
      "in all domestic animals, but it is most commonly met with in cattle. It\n",
      "usually affects young cattle. It most commonly occurs in the region of the\n",
      "face and neck. Thick, bran-like crusts form over the scattered areas of the\n",
      "skin and the hair drops out or breaks off. The animals frequently rub the\n",
      "infected area.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Prompt treatment_ may prevent the spread of this disease in the herd. It\n",
      "may be checked by quarantining the infected animals and scrubbing the\n",
      "stalls, stanchions and walls with a disinfecting solution. Grooming the\n",
      "infected animal should be discontinued. This skin disease responds most\n",
      "readily to ointments. Flowers of sulfur one part and lard ten parts is\n",
      "commonly used by stockmen. Sulfur-iodide ointment, or tincture of iodine\n",
      "may be applied.\n",

      "DISEASES OF THE EYE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--_The eye_ is situated in the orbital cavity, to which\n",
      "it is attached by muscles that rotate it in different directions. The\n",
      "_orbit_ is lined by fibro-fatty tissues that form a cushion for the eye.\n",
      "Anteriorly it is protected by the _eyelids_, and in birds by a third eyelid\n",
      "that corresponds to the membrana nictitans of quadrupeds. The _lachrymal\n",
      "gland_ which secretes the tears keeps the above parts moist.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The eye_ is the essential organ of vision. It is formed by a spherical\n",
      "shell which encloses fluid or semisolid parts. The shell is anteriorly made\n",
      "up of a transparent convex membrane, the cornea, while the remainder of its\n",
      "wall is formed by three opaque layers or tunics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The external tunic is the _sclerotic_. It is a white, solid membrane,\n",
      "forming about four-fifths of the external shell. Its external face is\n",
      "related to the muscles and fatty cushion. It receives posteriorly, a little\n",
      "lower than its middle portion, the insertion of the _optic nerve_, which\n",
      "passes through the shell and spreads out to form a very thin membrane, the\n",
      "retina or internal coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The retina_ lines about two-thirds of the posterior portion of the shell\n",
      "of the eye. It is made up of seven layers. The essential layer is named\n",
      "from its appearance, rods and cones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The middle coat is the _choroid_. This is a dark, pigmented, vascular and\n",
      "muscular membrane. The posterior portion is in contact with the retina.\n",
      "Anteriorly it forms the ciliary processes and the iris.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The media_ of the eye are the crystalline lens, vitreous and aqueous\n",
      "humors. The _crystalline lens_ is a transparent, biconvex body sustained by\n",
      "the ciliary processes. The _vitreous humor_ is a transparent jelly-like\n",
      "substance that fills all the cavity of the eye posterior to the lens. The\n",
      "_aqueous humor_ is a liquid, contained in the anterior and posterior\n",
      "chambers of the eye in front of the lens. This fluid separates the iris\n",
      "from the front of the lens.\n",

      "rough and hasty manipulation. The animal should be approached slowly. It is\n",
      "best for the attendant who is familiar with the animal to hold it for the\n",
      "examiner. It is advisable on approaching the animal to stroke its face, and\n",
      "in the horse to brush its foretop away. The hand should be carried slowly\n",
      "to the front of the eye, and the lids separated with the fingers and thumb\n",
      "if we wish to obtain a better view of the cornea. In cattle the best view\n",
      "of these parts can be obtained by taking hold of the nose and lifting the\n",
      "head. It is impossible to make a satisfactory examination of the eye\n",
      "outside of the stable where the light is coming from all directions. The\n",
      "most satisfactory conditions under which a general examination can be made\n",
      "is to stand the animal facing a transom, window or open door. We may then\n",
      "look directly into the eye and note the condition of the different\n",
      "refracting media.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lens should appear transparent and free from scars. The aqueous humor\n",
      "free from any cloudiness or precipitate. Both pupillary openings should be\n",
      "the same size, and not too small or too large in the bright light. As we\n",
      "look through the pupillary openings, both the lens and the vitreous humor\n",
      "should refract the light properly and not appear white or greenish-white in\n",
      "color. The color of the iris should be noted. If it lacks lustre or appears\n",
      "dull, this may indicate an inflammation. In periodic ophthalmia in horses\n",
      "the iris loses its lustre and becomes a rusty-brown color. It is very\n",
      "important to note this change in the appearance of the iris. We should\n",
      "note, in addition, the expression of the animal's face, the position of the\n",
      "ears and eyelids and manner of the walk. Horses that have defective sight\n",
      "may show a deep wrinkle in the upper eyelid when startled or looking\n",
      "directly at an object. Animals that are blind hold the ears in a\n",
      "characteristic position, and may stumble and walk over, or run into objects\n",
      "unless stopped. The ophthalmoscope is a very useful instrument for\n",

      "tears and the lids are held more or less closed. The mucous membrane is\n",
      "usually brick red in color and swollen. A little later the discharge\n",
      "becomes heavier and adheres more to the margins of the lids. The lids\n",
      "continue tender and the inflammation painful. The surface of the cornea may\n",
      "appear white and the blood-vessels prominent, but it is only in the severe\n",
      "cases that inflammation of this portion of the eye occurs. In such cases an\n",
      "elevation in body temperature may occur. This is especially true of\n",

      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. The first object must be\n",
      "to remove the cause. Irritating gases resulting from stable filth should be\n",
      "remedied by correcting the unsanitary conditions in the stable. Conditions\n",
      "favoring injury to the eye from foreign bodies, such as chaff and a\n",
      "careless attendant, should be corrected. Animals suffering from the\n",
      "infectious or purulent form of inflammation should be separated from the\n",
      "other animals. Foreign bodies should be removed promptly before they have\n",
      "had an opportunity to set up a serious inflammation. It is necessary to\n",

      "\n",
      "_The cause_ of this disease is not well understood. Certain local\n",
      "conditions seem to favor its development. Undrained land, a humid climate,\n",

      "have been mentioned as causative factors for this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ at the very beginning indicate a general inflammation of the\n",
      "eye. The eyelids are swollen, there is an abundant secretion of tears, the\n",
      "eyeball is retracted and the lids are held more or less closed. As the\n",
      "inflammation progresses, the cornea becomes milky in appearance and the\n",
      "aqueous humor may show a precipitate toward the bottom of the anterior\n",
      "chamber. The pupil is usually contracted and dilates slowly when the animal\n",

      "been given a rest to suffer from a second attack on being put to work. The\n",
      "attendant may observe a hazy or whitish condition of the margin of the\n",
      "cornea. The upper lid may show an abrupt bend of its margin and a deep\n",
      "wrinkle. The color of the iris appears to have lost its lustre, and the\n",

      "_Treatment_ is unsatisfactory. Preventive measures consist in avoiding\n",
      "conditions favorable to the production of the disease. This should be\n",
      "practised so far as possible. At the time the attack occurs, the animal\n",
      "should be given a cathartic. One pound of Glauber's salts in a drench is to\n",

      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The movements of the different parts of the animal\n",
      "body depend on the union of the bones that form the skeleton (Fig. 28), and\n",
      "mode of insertion of the muscles. The bones meet and form _joints_ or\n",
      "_articulations_. These are divided into three classes: _movable_, _mixed_\n",
      "and _immovable_. Nearly all of the articulations in the extremities belong\n",
      "to the movable class. The articulations between the bodies of the vertebrae\n",
      "belong to the mixed, and those between the flat bones of the head to the\n",
      "immovable class.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Skeleton of horse.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The bony surfaces that meet and form the different types of articulations\n",
      "are held together by ligaments (Fig. 29). Sometimes the ligament is placed\n",
      "between the bony surfaces, but usually it is attached to the margins of the\n",
      "articular surfaces that it unites. The _immovable class_ possesses\n",
      "fibrous-like ligaments that are placed between the margins of the flat\n",
      "bones that form the articulation. The _mixed articulations_ are united by a\n",
      "fibro-cartilaginous pad that is firmly attached to the articular faces of\n",
      "the bones, and by peripheral ligaments that may be flat or formed by\n",
      "scattered fibres. All _movable articulations_ are formed by bony surfaces\n",
      "encrusted with a thin cartilaginous layer that makes them perfectly smooth,\n",
      "ligaments and complimentary cartilages. Sometimes the bony surfaces do not\n",
      "fit each other, and we find between them _fibro-cartilages_ that complete\n",
      "the articulation by adapting the articular surfaces to each other. _Round_\n",
      "or _flat ligaments_ may extend from one articular surface to the other, and\n",
      "attached to the margins of the articulation are _membranous, flat_ or\n",
      "_round ligaments_. Muscles and tendons that cross the articulations should\n",
      "be included among the structures binding them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Photograph of model of stifle joint, showing:\n",
      "ligaments; complementary cartilages; femur; and tibia.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Movable joints possess a _synovial membrane_. This membrane lines the\n",
      "structures that enclose the articulation and secretes a fluid, _the\n",
      "synovia_, that lubricates the surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The muscles_ are the contractile organs that move the body. The movement\n",
      "of the different parts of the body is rendered possible through the manner\n",
      "in which the skeletal muscles are inserted into the long bones, by which\n",
      "the lever motion is possible. A muscle originating on one bone and\n",
      "terminating on another either moves both bones toward each other or, if one\n",
      "attachment is fixed, the movable is drawn toward the fixed part.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may class muscles as _striated_ or _voluntary_ and _unstriated_ or\n",
      "_involuntary._ A third class, _mixed,_ is represented by the heart muscle.\n",
      "The striated is represented by the skeletal muscles, and the unstriated by\n",
      "the thin muscular layers that form part of the wall of the stomach,\n",
      "intestines, bladder and other hollow organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "RHEUMATISM.--This is an inflammation of the tissues that form the\n",
      "locomotory apparatus. The effect of cold on the muscles and tendons is an\n",
      "important factor in its production. It differs from other inflammations by\n",
      "shifting from one part to another. It is termed _muscular rheumatism_ when\n",
      "it affects the muscles, tendons and fascia, and _articular rheumatism_ when\n",
      "it involves the articulations. A second classification, _acute_ and\n",
      "_chronic,_ depends on the character of the inflammation. The muscular form\n",
      "is common in horses, dogs and hogs, while the articular form more commonly\n",
      "affects cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The following causes_ may be considered. Animals that are exposed to cold,\n",
      "wet, changeable weather, or kept in cold, damp, draughty quarters\n",
      "frequently suffer from rheumatism. Under such conditions it is very\n",
      "probable that imperfect metabolism of body tissue occurs, and certain toxic\n",
      "products that are capable of irritating the muscles and articulations form.\n",
      "Clinical symptoms, and the presence of bacteria in the inflamed tissue\n",
      "indicate that bacteria and their toxins play an important part in the\n",
      "development of articular rheumatism. Heredity is said to be an important\n",
      "predisposing factor. One attack always predisposes the animal to a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms vary_ according to the severity of the attack. Local\n",
      "rheumatism is not accompanied by serious symptoms. The regions most\n",
      "commonly involved in local, muscular rheumatism are the shoulder, neck and\n",
      "back. The joints affected in the articular form are the knee, fetlock, hip,\n",
      "elbow and shoulder. The attack is usually sudden and accompanied by fever,\n",
      "more or less loss of appetite and soreness. Loss of control over the\n",
      "movement of the hind parts or walking on the knees may occur in the smaller\n",
      "animals. The larger animals show a slight or severe lameness. The affected\n",
      "muscle or articulation may be swollen, hot and tender. Pressing on the part\n",
      "with the hand or forcing the animal to move about may cause severe pain.\n",
      "Weakness and emaciation may occur in generalized and articular rheumatism,\n",
      "especially if suppuration takes place in the affected joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The prognosis_ is more favorable in muscular rheumatism than in the\n",
      "articular form. Both forms may become chronic. It is frequently advisable\n",
      "to destroy animals suffering from the articular form because of their\n",
      "emaciated, weakened condition and the deformed condition of the joints.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions favorable to the\n",
      "production of rheumatism. In ventilating the stable we should avoid\n",
      "draughts. Practical experience indicates that allowing a horse to stand in\n",
      "a draught after it has been warmed up by exercise is a very common source\n",
      "of muscular rheumatism and is especially to be avoided. Young hogs and sows\n",
      "that are thin are very prone to rheumatism when given wet, draughty\n",
      "sleeping quarters. Houses having dirt or loose board floors are very often\n",
      "draughty. Concrete floors when wet and not properly bedded with straw are\n",
      "objectionable. Although we do not fully understand the causative factors,\n",
      "we can take advantage of the knowledge we have gained from practical\n",
      "experience, and avoid keeping animals under conditions that are favorable\n",
      "for the production of the disease. It is almost useless to treat rheumatism\n",
      "unless the conditions under which it occurred are corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both local and internal. The local treatment consists in\n",
      "applying a mild liniment to the part, together with massage. If the part is\n",
      "tender and painful, hot applications may be used. Spirits of camphor ten\n",
      "parts and turpentine two parts, applied daily, are useful in relieving the\n",
      "soreness of rheumatic muscles. Salicylate of soda two ounces, fluid extract\n",
      "of gentian one ounce, and sufficient water to make an eight-ounce mixture\n",
      "may be given internally three times daily after feeding. Of the above\n",
      "mixture horses and cattle may be given one-half ounce and sheep and swine\n",
      "from one to two drachms. The treatment should be continued for a period of\n",
      "from eight to ten days or longer. It may be repeated in from one to two\n",
      "weeks.\n",

      "\n",
      "AZOTURIA, HAEMOGLOBINURIA.--This is a disease of solipeds affecting the\n",

      "paralyzed. The disease follows a short rest, and rarely occurs when the\n",
      "animal is running in pasture or idle for a long period. Animals that are\n",
      "fat or rapidly putting on fat are predisposed to it. Animals that have had\n",
      "one attack are predisposed to a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The cause_ of this disease is not positively known. The German\n",
      "veterinarians attribute it to irritation of the muscles by cold, and\n",
      "classify azoturia as a rheumatic disorder. The conditions preceding the\n",
      "attack are not in favor of this theory, and cold can not be considered an\n",
      "important causative factor. The most acceptable is the auto-poisoning\n",
      "theory advanced by Dr. Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Azoturia is common in the country where feed is abundant and wrong methods\n",
      "of feeding horses are commonly practised. It is a very common practice to\n",
      "feed horses accustomed to hard work the same ration when idle for a few\n",
      "days as when working. The blood of horses cared for in this way may become\n",
      "abnormally rich in albuminoids. The suddenness of the attack, occurring\n",
      "shortly after the animal is given exercise, indicates auto-poisoning. This\n",
      "may be due to the blood in the portal vessels and the liver capillaries,\n",
      "charged with nutritious and waste products from the overfed animal's\n",
      "intestines, being suddenly thrown into the general circulation by a more\n",
      "active circulation of the blood brought on by exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ of disease are manifested shortly after the animal is moved\n",
      "out of the stall and given exercise. When the animal is first exercised it\n",
      "is usually in high spirits. After travelling a short distance it is noticed\n",
      "to sweat more freely than ordinarily, breathe rapidly, lag and go lame,\n",
      "usually in the hind limbs. It trembles, shows evidence of suffering severe\n",
      "pain by turning its head and looking around toward the flanks, knuckles\n",
      "over in the hind pasterns, and may fall down and be unable to get up. The\n",
      "affected muscles appear to be swollen and feel unusually firm when pressed\n",
      "upon with the hand. If the horse does not go down recovery may occur within\n",
      "a few hours, and we are able to move the horse to the stable. Dark brown\n",
      "urine may be passed. At other times, the animal lies in a natural position,\n",
      "possesses a good appetite, but can not stand. In the severe form, it is\n",
      "restless and shows marked nervous symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The prognosis_ is unfavorable in the severe form. When nervous symptoms\n",
      "are absent recovery usually occurs in from two to ten days. Complications\n",
      "are common. More or less atrophy of the muscles of the quarters may result\n",
      "(Fig. 30).\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions that may favor\n",
      "the production of the disease. More attention should be given the feeding\n",
      "and care of work animals. If it is not possible to permit horses that are\n",

      "STRUCTURE OF THE LIMBS OF THE HORSE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--Each limb is formed by a column of bones that rest\n",
      "upon one another, forming more or less open angles. The bones of the column\n",
      "meet and form articulations that are held together by ligaments, and\n",
      "attached to their faces, borders and extremities are muscles and tendons.\n",
      "In the superior portion of the limb the muscles are heavy, tapering\n",
      "inferiorly, and terminating in the region of the foot in long tendons. Each\n",
      "limb is divided into four regions. The regions of the _fore-limb_ are the\n",
      "shoulder, arm, forearm and forefoot. In the _hind limb_ are the regions of\n",
      "the pelvis, haunch, thigh, leg and hind-foot. The feet in turn are divided\n",
      "into three sub-regions each. The _forefoot_ is formed by the knee, cannon\n",
      "and toe, and the _hindfoot_ by the hock, cannon and toe.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SHOULDER BONE OR SCAPULA is flat and triangular in shape. It is\n",
      "attached to the trunk by heavy muscles, one of which, together with its\n",
      "fellow on the opposite side, may be compared to a great, muscular sling\n",
      "that supports about two-thirds of the body weight. Attached to the internal\n",
      "and external faces of the scapula are heavy muscles that pass over the\n",
      "shoulder-joint, and become attached to the arm bone through the insertion\n",
      "of their muscular fibres or by a short tendon.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE ARMBONE OR HUMERUS belongs to the class of long bones. Its superior\n",
      "extremity forms a flattened head that fits rather imperfectly into a\n",
      "shallow cavity in the humeral angle of the scapula. The inferior extremity\n",
      "resembles a portion of a cylinder in shape, and fits into shallow\n",
      "depressions in the superior extremity of the principal bone of the forearm.\n",
      "The muscles here are divided into two regions, anterior and posterior\n",
      "brachial. The most of these muscles originate on the posterior border and\n",
      "inferior extremity of the shoulder bone, and terminate inferiorly on the\n",
      "superior extremities of the principal and second or rudimentary bone of the\n",
      "forearm. The posterior brachial muscles are heavy and powerful. They are\n",
      "sometimes termed elbow muscles, because they are attached to the point of\n",
      "the elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE REGION OF THE FOREARM is formed by two bones, the _radius_ and _ulna_.\n",
      "The radius is the principal bone and is classed among the long bones. The\n",
      "ulna is an elongated flat bone. It is attached to the external portion of\n",
      "the posterior face of the radius and extends above the superior extremity\n",
      "of this bone to form the point of the elbow. The radius articulates with\n",
      "the upper row of knee bones. The muscles of this region, the antibrachial,\n",
      "are divided into two sub-regions, anterior and posterior. They originate\n",
      "superiorly from the lower extremity of the arm bone and the superior\n",
      "extremities of the bones of the forearm, and terminate toward the lower\n",
      "extremity of the region in tendons that become attached to the bones of the\n",
      "knee, cannon and digit.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE KNEE OR CARPAL region is formed by seven short bones that are arranged\n",
      "in two rows. They form a series of articulations. These are the\n",
      "articulations between the two rows, between the bones of each row, and\n",
      "between the upper and lower rows and the neighboring regions. Nearly all\n",
      "the motion takes place in the articulation between the upper row and the\n",
      "principal bone of the forearm.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE CANNON OR METACARPAL region is formed by three bones. These are the\n",
      "principal metacarpal or cannon bone, and the rudimentary metacarpal or\n",
      "splint bones. The latter are attached to the margins of the posterior face\n",
      "of the cannon bone. The superior extremities of these bones articulate with\n",
      "the lower row of carpal bones. The convex extremity of the cannon bone\n",
      "meets shallow depressions in the superior extremity of the first digital\n",
      "bone. This is termed the fetlock joint. The anterior and posterior faces of\n",
      "this region are travelled by the long tendons belonging to the extensor and\n",
      "flexor muscles of the digit.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE DIGIT OR TOE is formed by six bones, three of which are termed\n",
      "accessory or sesamoids. The digital bones may be given numerical names.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE APPROXIMAL OR THIRD DIGITAL BONE is the shortest long bone in the body.\n",
      "The two shallow articular cavities belonging to the superior extremity are\n",
      "completed posteriorly by the two sesamoid bones. The inferior extremity is\n",
      "smaller than the superior and resembles the inferior extremity of the\n",
      "cannon bone in shape, excepting that it shows a middle groove. The anterior\n",
      "and posterior faces are travelled by the tendons of the digital muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MIDDLE OR SECOND DIGITAL BONE is quite short. It articulates superiorly\n",
      "with the first, and inferiorly with the third bone of the digit. The\n",
      "superior face shows two shallow cavities, and the inferior two convex\n",
      "surfaces separated by a median groove. The latter face articulates with the\n",
      "third and navicular bones. The popular name for this articulation is the\n",
      "coffin joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE THIRD OR DISTAL DIGITAL BONE may be compared to a cone that has been\n",
      "cut away posteriorly, obliquely downwards and backwards. The superior face\n",
      "shows two shallow cavities that are completed posteriorly by the superior\n",
      "face of the coffin or navicular bone. The anterior face is convex and\n",
      "cribbled by openings, and the inferior face is concave, forming the sole.\n",
      "Tendons belonging to the digital muscles terminate on the summit and\n",
      "inferior face of this bone.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PELVIS OR HAUNCH is formed by a single bone, the _coxa_ that in the\n",
      "foetus may be divided into three bones. These are the _ilium, pubis_ and\n",
      "_ischium_. It belongs to the class of flat bones. Anteriorly it is\n",
      "flattened from before to behind and directed inward and upward. The\n",
      "external angle is rugged and is generally termed the angle of the haunch.\n",
      "The internal face of the opposite angle articulates with the sacrum, to\n",
      "which it is firmly attached by ligaments. The middle portion is constricted\n",
      "and forms a neck. The inferior or posterior portion is flattened from above\n",
      "to below, and directed inward to meet the border of the opposite bone. Just\n",
      "below the neck and externally, there is a cup-shaped cavity into which the\n",
      "head of the thigh bone fits. The two coxa, together with the sacral\n",
      "ligaments (sacrum) and the muscles of the quarter, enclose the pelvic\n",
      "cavity.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE REGION OF THE THIGH is formed by the _femur_, the largest long bone in\n",
      "the body. The superior extremity is formed by a rugged eminence, to which\n",
      "the heavy muscles of the quarter are attached, and by an articular head.\n",
      "The inferior extremity is formed by two convex articular surfaces that are\n",
      "separated by a deep notch, and a third pulley-like articular surface, with\n",
      "which the patella or knee-cap articulates. The pair of condyles articulates\n",
      "with the superior extremity of the leg bone. The thigh or femoral region is\n",
      "heavily muscled.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE LEG is formed by three bones. The patella, a short bone, has already\n",
      "been mentioned as articulating with the thigh bone. The tibia and fibula\n",
      "are the other two bones in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE TIBIA belongs to the class of long bones and the fibula is quite\n",
      "rudimentary, being represented by a stylet-shaped bone that lies posterior\n",
      "to, and along the outer border of the tibia. The superior extremity of the\n",
      "tibia shows a central spine margined laterally by rather plain articular\n",
      "faces. It articulates with the thigh bone. The muscles of this region are\n",
      "divided into two sub-regions, _anterior_ and _posterior_ tibial. The\n",
      "muscles originate from the lower extremity of the femur and the two bones\n",
      "in this region, and terminate inferiorly in tendons that are attached to\n",
      "the bones of the hock, cannon and digit.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE HOCK OR TARSAL region is formed by six bones. They are described as\n",
      "forming two rows. In the upper row there are two bones and in the lower\n",
      "four. They form a series of articulations, the same as the bones of the\n",
      "knee. Practically all of the movement occurs in the articulation between\n",
      "one of the large bones in the upper row and the lower extremity of the\n",
      "tibia. It may be mentioned here that this is the most perfect hinge-joint\n",
      "in the body. A very large tendon is attached to the summit of the hock.\n",
      "Other tendons cross and become attached to the hock bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regions of the _hind cannon_ and digit are practically the same as the\n",
      "corresponding regions of the forefoot.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The value of a horse depends largely on the condition\n",
      "of the limbs and their ability to do the work for which they are intended.\n",
      "This fact is frequently overlooked by experienced horsemen, who give\n",
      "attention to general conformation and action rather than to soundness of\n",
      "limb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diseases affecting the limbs may be classed as _unsoundnesses_ and\n",
      "_blemishes_. This classification is based on the degree to which the\n",
      "disease interferes or may interfere with the work that the animal is called\n",
      "on to perform. Unsoundnesses interfere with the use of the part or the use\n",
      "of the animal for a certain work; blemishes do not. Such a basis for the\n",
      "classification of diseases does not enable us to place certain diseased\n",
      "conditions of the limbs in the unsound, or the blemish class at all times.\n",
      "A curb may, if it produces lameness, be classed as an unsoundness. If it\n",
      "does not cause the animal to go lame, and the enlargement on the posterior\n",
      "border of the hock is small, it is classed as a blemish. A high splint may\n",
      "place the animal in the unsound class, but usually a low splint is not\n",
      "considered a serious blemish. This classification is based to a certain\n",
      "extent on the relative economic importance of the disease, or the influence\n",
      "that the disease may have on the value of the animal, as well as any\n",
      "interference with the animal's ability to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "RECOGNITION OF THE DISEASE.--The seat of the disease may be in a muscle,\n",
      "tendon, bone or ligament. The general symptom manifested is lameness or\n",
      "pain. The local symptoms are heat, pain, swelling and bony enlargements.\n",
      "The degree of lameness and the character of the local lesions vary greatly\n",
      "in the different cases. When the animal shows a slight lameness and there\n",
      "is little evidence of any local symptom, it requires the services of a\n",
      "skilled and experienced person to locate the diseased part. When the part\n",
      "shows local lesions of disease and the lameness is characteristic,\n",
      "diagnosis is not difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE EXAMINATION should be made while the animal is at rest; while standing\n",
      "in the stall and on level ground; when moved at a walk, or a slow trot on\n",
      "soft ground, or a hard roadway; and when moved out after resting a few\n",
      "hours. While examining the animal under the different conditions mentioned,\n",
      "the examiner must be careful and not pass over any part of a limb without\n",
      "determining whether it is normal or not. He should note any abnormal\n",
      "position that the animal may take while standing at rest. Every movement\n",
      "should be watched closely, as the manner of favoring the part may\n",
      "characterize the lameness. Negative symptoms of lameness in a part may at\n",
      "times prove as valuable in forming a diagnosis as positive symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resting of either of the front feet, when the horse is standing at\n",
      "ease, indicates that there is some soreness in the rested limb. _Pointing_\n",
      "or placing one or both feet well in front of the line of support, when the\n",
      "animal is standing, usually indicates a diseased condition of the feet. It\n",
      "is natural for a horse that is standing in a stall to rest the hindfeet\n",
      "alternately. When the hindfoot is rested because of a soreness in some\n",
      "portion of the limb, it may be flexed or extended, the weight rested on the\n",
      "toe, and the foot flexed and bearing practically no weight. In serious\n",
      "inflammation of the front feet, both feet may be placed well in front of\n",
      "the normal position, and the hindfeet well under the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEN EXAMINING A HORSE, the blanket or harness should be removed. The horse\n",
      "should have on an open bridle or halter, and the attendant should give it\n",
      "as much freedom of the head as possible. The examiner should examine each\n",
      "limb carefully and note any symptom of disease that may be present. The\n",
      "attendant should walk the animal straight away from the person making the\n",
      "examination, toward, and past him, so that the animal's movements can be\n",
      "observed from both sides, from behind and in front. This examination should\n",
      "be repeated with the horse at a slow trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character of the lameness may enable us to locate the seat of the\n",
      "disease. We must first determine in which limb the animal is lame. This\n",
      "part of the diagnosis is not difficult. The pain suffered every time weight\n",
      "is thrown on the diseased limb causes the horse to step quickly and shift\n",
      "as much of the body weight as possible on the well foot. The foot of the\n",
      "lame limb is jerked up rather quickly after weight is thrown on it. This\n",
      "favoring of the part varies in the different diseases. When the foot of the\n",
      "sound limb comes to the ground, more weight than common is placed on it. If\n",
      "the seat of the lameness is in a front limb, there is a decided nodding or\n",
      "movement of the head downward when the weight is placed on the well foot.\n",
      "If both forefeet are diseased, the animal steps shorter and more quickly\n",
      "than common. Lameness in a hind limb is characterized by more or less\n",
      "dropping of the quarter of the well limb when weight is thrown on it, and\n",
      "sometimes by a \"hitch\" or elevation of the quarter of the diseased limb\n",
      "when it is carried forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless there are _local symptoms of disease_ present, it may be quite\n",
      "difficult to locate the seat of lameness. Sometimes local symptoms are\n",
      "misleading. After the lameness has been located in a certain limb, its\n",
      "movement must be carefully noted in order to detect the part favored. If\n",
      "the lameness is not characteristic enough to enable the examiner to locate\n",
      "the seat of it, it is then necessary to put the animal through some\n",
      "movement that may emphasize the soreness in the part. The animal may show a\n",
      "certain reluctance to throw weight on the limb when turned to the right or\n",
      "left. Moving the horse in a small circle with the lame limb on the outside\n",
      "may cause the animal to use the muscles of the shoulder more freely, and\n",
      "emphasize any soreness that may be present. If the lame limb is on the\n",
      "inside, soreness anywhere in the foot may be increased, because of the\n",
      "extra weight thrown on this portion of the limb. Moving the animal over a\n",
      "hard driveway may increase the pain resulting from an inflammation of the\n",
      "feet. Causing the animal to trot on soft ground, step over high objects,\n",
      "flexing, extending, abducting and adducting the part may enable the\n",
      "examiner to locate the exact group of shoulder or arm muscles involved by\n",
      "the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "IN EXAMINING THE FEET it may be necessary to remove the shoes and practise\n",
      "percussion and pressure over the region of the sole. In some forms of\n",
      "lameness it may be necessary to destroy the sensation in the foot by\n",
      "injecting cocaine along the course of the nerves that supply the foot\n",
      "before arriving at a definite diagnosis.\n",

      "\n",
      "SPRAINS AND INJURIES IN THE REGION OF THE SHOULDER.--Sprains and injuries\n",
      "of the structures in the shoulder region are more common in horses that are\n",
      "called on to do heavy work than among driving horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _causes_ may be mentioned: Ill-fitting collars, pulling heavy\n",
      "loads over uneven streets or soft ground, where the footing is not secure,\n",
      "and slipping are common causes. Young horses that do not know how to pull,\n",
      "or horses that are tired out by hard work, are predisposed to muscular\n",
      "strain, and are apt to suffer injury if forced to do heavy work. Sore\n",
      "shoulders, or an ignorant driver, may cause the animal to pull awkwardly\n",
      "and throw more strain on certain groups of muscles than they can stand.\n",
      "Rheumatism frequently causes shoulder lameness. The muscle usually affected\n",
      "by rheumatism is the large muscle extending from the region of the point of\n",
      "the shoulder to the summit of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Shoulder lameness.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ of shoulder lameness vary in the different cases. The horse\n",
      "may walk without going lame, but when made to trot lameness is quite\n",
      "noticeable. The animal may point with the foot of the diseased limb,\n",
      "holding it forward, but squarely on the floor. In severe strain, little\n",
      "weight is thrown on the limb and the lameness is marked (Fig. 31). In\n",
      "\"shoulder slip\" the head of the arm bone pushes outward every time the\n",
      "animal throws weight on the limb. This luxation can be noticed best when\n",
      "standing in front of the animal. Marked atrophy of the external shoulder\n",
      "muscles may occur. Such atrophy may appear and disappear quickly, and may\n",
      "result from an injury to the nerve supply of the muscle as well as from\n",
      "favoring the part. Atrophy of the shoulder may occur if the animal is lame\n",
      "in other regions of the limb, especially the feet. The outcome of shoulder\n",
      "lameness is favorable if the disease causing it is given prompt treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Rest_ is a very important part of the _treatment_. It may be advisable to\n",
      "restrict the horse's movements by placing it in a single stall, and tying\n",
      "the animal so that it can not lie down. This should be continued for at\n",
      "least one week. If the horse is restless, it should be given a box-stall or\n",
      "turned out in a small lot alone. It should be watered and fed in the\n",
      "quarters where confined. The _local treatment_ consists in applying mild\n",
      "liniments or blisters to the shoulder. It is not advisable, however, to\n",
      "apply a blister if the muscles feel hot and tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "CAPPED ELBOW, \"SHOE-BOIL.\"--Capped elbow is an inflammation of the bursa at\n",
      "the posterior surface of the elbow (Fig. 32). The swelling that results is\n",
      "usually sharply defined. It may feel abnormally warm and doughy, and it may\n",
      "be painful. Later, the enlargement may be well defined and hard. Sometimes\n",
      "the skin is indurated and lies in folds, or the shoe-boil shows abrasions\n",
      "on its surface and fistulous openings leading from abscess centres. The\n",
      "cystic or soft tumor is a common form. Such an enlargement fluctuates on\n",
      "pressure, and when opened, a blood-stained fluid escapes. All forms of\n",
      "capped elbow tend to become chronic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and local. As capped elbow is caused by\n",
      "bruising the part with the hoof or heel of the shoe, the preventive\n",
      "treatment consists in hindering the animal from taking a position that may\n",
      "favor injury to the part. Confining the animal in a small stall and tying\n",
      "it with too short a halter strap favors a sternal position when lying down.\n",
      "A roomy stall that permits the animal to stretch or change position is an\n",
      "important preventive measure. Shoes that project beyond the quarters should\n",
      "be avoided. The elbow may be protected by placing a thick pad over the\n",
      "heels when the animal is in the stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Shoe-boil.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_Local treatment_ varies according to the character of the enlargement.\n",
      "Soft, doughy swellings may be treated by application of cold, iodine and\n",
      "blisters. The cystic form of tumor must be opened, the fluid removed and\n",
      "the lining membrane destroyed by the injection of tincture of iodine. Hard,\n",
      "indurated shoe-boils may be treated by completely removing the diseased\n",
      "tissue. The surgical treatment of capped elbow requires the service of an\n",
      "experienced veterinarian. His efforts may prove a complete failure, unless\n",
      "the irritation to the part by the shoe or hoof is prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "INJURIES TO THE KNEE (BROKEN KNEE).--Horses frequently fall and bruise or\n",
      "lacerate the knee when moving at trot or canter. The injury varies\n",
      "according to the force of the fall, and the character of the road that the\n",
      "animal is travelling over. Some individuals are more liable to suffer from\n",
      "this class of injuries than others. Horses that are weak-kneed because of\n",
      "poor conformation, or knee-sprung, are inclined to stumble. Careless\n",
      "driving, especially if the animal is tired, predisposes it to this class of\n",
      "injury. Because of the predisposition toward stumbling on the part of some\n",
      "horses, scars on the front of the knee are termed broken knee, and the\n",
      "animal is considered unsound.\n",

      "_The symptoms_ vary with the extent of the injury. Slight bruises or\n",
      "abrasions result in local swelling and soreness that disappear within a few\n",
      "days. Laceration of skin interferes with the movement of the knee and the\n",
      "animal may be quite lame. The part becomes swollen and painful. In injuries\n",
      "involving the sheaths of the tendons and the synovial membrane, the pain is\n",
      "severe and the accompanying inflammation may take on a serious form.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ should not be overlooked. Horses should be\n",
      "trained to carry the head at a proper height when moving. The driver should\n",

      "that he is driving. Superficial bruises require no special treatment other\n",
      "than rest. Laceration of the skin and underlying tissue requires complete\n",
      "rest and careful removal of any particles, of dirt and gravel that may be\n",
      "present in the wound. Shreds of tissue that may take no part in the healing\n",
      "should be cut away. The hair in the region of the wound should be trimmed\n",
      "short. Careful and repeated dressings with antiseptics are necessary until\n",
      "the inflammation has largely disappeared and healing is rapidly taking\n",

      "DISTENDED SYNOVIAL SACS, JOINT SHEATHS AND BURSAE, \"GALLS.\"--Soft\n",
      "enlargements may occur in the region of the knee and fetlock. They are\n",
      "commonly termed \"galls,\" \"wind-galls,\" or \"road-puffs.\" They are usually\n",
      "due to the sheaths surrounding the tendons becoming distended with synovia.\n",
      "\"Galls\" are caused by strains, direct injury to the part and severe,\n",
      "continuous work. Certain individuals may develop this class of blemishes\n",

      "accompanied by lameness.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ may vary in the different cases. If the distended sheath,\n",
      "or bursal enlargement, is caused by a direct injury or strain, cold\n",
      "bandages should be applied and the part given as complete rest as possible.\n",
      "\"Wind-galls\" may be removed by a surgical operation. It is not advisable to\n",

      "SPRUNG KNEES (BUCK KNEES).--This condition of the knee is characterized by\n",
      "the partly flexed condition of the region. It is best observed by standing\n",
      "to one side of the horse (Fig. 33). Instead of the forearm and cannon\n",
      "regions appearing perpendicular or in line, they are directed forward. This\n",
      "condition may exist in varying degrees. Some individuals show it to a\n",
      "slight degree, the condition being accompanied by a weakness or shakiness\n",
      "of the knee when standing at rest. Sometimes, but one knee is involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ of this unsoundness are hereditary and accidental. Weak knees\n",
      "due to faulty conformation seldom escape becoming sprung in animals that\n",
      "are given hard work. Severe and continuous driving is a common factor in\n",
      "the production of this condition. Strains of the flexor muscles of the\n",
      "region may cause it. The retraction of the flexor muscles and their tendons\n",
      "and the aponeurosis of the antibrachial region occurs in this disorder and\n",
      "prevents the animal from extending the knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The region is greatly weakened by this condition and the animal may be\n",
      "unfitted for active work. For this reason the value of the animal is\n",
      "greatly diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Treatment_ is unsatisfactory. The preventive treatment consists in not\n",
      "breeding animals that have poorly conformed knees and using the proper\n",
      "judgment in working young horses and when driving or riding horses. Certain\n",
      "cases may be greatly benefited by sectioning the tendons of the external\n",

      "\n",
      "SPLINTS.--A splint is a bony enlargement situated along the line of\n",
      "articulation between the splint and cannon bones (Fig. 34). This blemish is\n",
      "due to an inflammation of the periosteum. It is a very common blemish and\n",
      "is generally located along the splint bones of the forefeet, especially the\n",
      "internal ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Splints are caused_ by strains and rupture of the ligament that binds the\n",
      "splint bone to the cannon bone. The result is an inflammation of the\n",
      "periosteum. Slipping, or an unbalanced condition of the foot, may cause\n",
      "this injury by distributing the weight unequally on the splint bones.\n",
      "Faulty action and bad shoeing may cause the horse to strike and bruise the\n",
      "region.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Symptoms of lameness_ are not always present. A high splint involving the\n",
      "articulation between the lower row of carpal, splint and cannon bones may\n",
      "be considered an unsoundness, because of the persistent character of the\n",
      "lameness. The animal may show little or no lameness when walked, but if\n",
      "moved at a trot, especially over a hard roadway, it may show marked\n",
      "lameness. The local inflammation is characterized by a small swelling lying\n",
      "along the splint bone, that feels hot and may pit on pressure. After a time\n",
      "the inflammation disappears and is replaced by a hard, bony enlargement.\n",
      "When this occurs the lameness disappears.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in keeping the feet of young horses in\n",
      "proper balance by frequent trimming and proper shoeing. This attention is\n",
      "very necessary in young colts that are running in pasture. It is very\n",
      "advisable to rest the animal during the period of inflammation. Cold\n",
      "bandages should be applied. As soon as the inflammation has subsided mild\n",
      "counterirritants and absorbents may be used. In. case the lameness\n",
      "persists, more severe counterirritation is indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "INFLAMMATION OF THE FLEXOR TENDONS OF THE DIGIT.--The large tendons\n",
      "posterior to the foot and the suspensory ligament that separates them from\n",
      "the cannon bone frequently become inflamed. Sometimes complete rupture of\n",
      "one or more of these structures occurs. The lighter breeds of horses are\n",
      "the most frequent sufferers. Because of the greater strain thrown on the\n",
      "tendons of the forefeet, inflammation of these tendons is far more common\n",
      "than it is in the hindfoot. Diseased conditions of the hind tendons are\n",
      "usually due to other causes than strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _predisposing_ and _accidental causes_ should be considered:\n",
      "Weak flexor tendons and heavy bodies predispose animals to inflammation of\n",
      "the tendons and suspensory ligament; quality, not size, is the factor to\n",
      "consider when judging the strength of a tendon; long, slender pasterns\n",
      "increase the strain on these structures, and this mechanical strain is\n",
      "further increased by low heels and long toes; the character of the work and\n",
      "the condition of the road that the animal travels over are important\n",
      "factors to consider; trotting and running horses more often suffer from\n",
      "injuries to tendons and ligaments than draft horses; travelling at a high\n",
      "rate of speed over an uneven road, slipping and catching the foot in a rut\n",
      "or car track, are common causes; bruises and wounds may result in the\n",
      "tendons becoming inflamed; inflammation of the tendinous sheaths and the\n",
      "tendons as well sometimes occurs in influenza.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Lameness_ is a prominent _symptom._ The pastern is held in a more upright\n",
      "position than normal. When the animal is standing, the foot is rested on\n",
      "the toe, and it may take advantage of any uneven place on which to rest the\n",
      "heel. In severe strains the local symptoms are quite prominent. The tendons\n",
      "may be hot and swollen. Pressure may cause the animal pain. In chronic\n",
      "tendinitis the tendon may be thickened and rough or knotty. Pain is not a\n",
      "prominent symptom in this class of cases. Shortening of the inflamed tendon\n",
      "may occur, causing the animal to knuckle over. Rupture of one or more of\n",
      "the tendons and the suspensory ligament can be recognized by the abnormal\n",
      "extension of the pastern. If the ruptured tendon heals, it always results\n",
      "in a thickening at the point of the rupture that gives the tendons a bowed\n",
      "appearance. This is termed bowed-tendon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lameness resulting from an inflammation of tendons resembles that\n",
      "resulting from strains and injuries to the fetlock joint, especially in the\n",
      "region of the sesamoid bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "INFLAMMATION OF THE SESAMOID BONES differs slightly from the former.\n",
      "Pressure over the posterior region of the fetlock may cause the animal\n",
      "pain. The lameness shows a tendency to disappear with rest and reappear\n",
      "when the animal is again worked. Lameness is most prominent in some cases\n",
      "when the animal is first moved out. There may be a lack of local symptoms,\n",
      "such as heat and swelling. It is not uncommon for a bony enlargement to\n",
      "form on the sesamoid bone after a few months or a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _treatment_ is recommended. Horses that have a poor quality\n",
      "of tendon and weak fetlocks and pasterns should not be used for breeding\n",
      "purposes. Careful driving would prevent a large percentage of injuries to\n",
      "tendons. The most important treatment for all injuries due to strains is\n",
      "rest. In all cases of severe strain to the structures in this region, it is\n",
      "very advisable to apply a plaster bandage. This should be left on for at\n",
      "least two weeks. When the acute inflammation has subsided, counterirritants\n",
      "may be applied. Either cold or hot applications are recommended. Cold\n",
      "applications are to be preferred at the beginning of the inflammation.\n",
      "Covering the tendons with a cold bandage, or with a heavy layer of\n",
      "antiphlogistin, is recommended. The horse should not be worked until after\n",
      "the tendons have had an opportunity to completely recover from the\n",
      "inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTRACTED TENDONS, KNUCKLING-OVER.--New-born foals are sometimes unable to\n",
      "stand on their front feet because of the excessive knuckling-over. The colt\n",
      "may walk on the front of the pastern and fetlock. This sometimes results in\n",
      "severe injury to the skin and the underlying tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knuckling-over in the mature horse is not always due to contracted tendons.\n",
      "It may occur as a symptom of inflammation of the flexor tendons, ligaments\n",
      "of the fetlock joint and the articulation as well. It may be noticed in\n",
      "animals that have ring-bone, or coffin-joint lameness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most _common cause_ for this unsoundness is inflammation of the muscles\n",
      "and tendons of the flexors of the digit. As a result of long standing or\n",
      "severe inflammation, shortening of these structures occurs in consequence\n",
      "of the contraction of the inflammatory or cicatricial tissue.\n",
      "Knuckling-over in the newborn colt is commonly caused by a weakness or lack\n",
      "of innervation of the extensor muscle of the digit. Judging from the quick\n",
      "recovery that usually occurs, other causes for this condition are seldom\n",
      "present.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ recommended for the new-born colt is supporting the fetlock\n",
      "with a light plaster bandage. This should be applied very soon after birth\n",
      "in order to prevent bruising of the fetlock. A light cheese-cloth bandage\n",
      "should be applied to the limb from the hoof to the knee. The colt is laid\n",
      "on its side, the toe extended as much as possible, and the plaster bandage\n",
      "applied. This should be removed in about one week and fresh bandages\n",
      "applied. In about two weeks the young animal is usually able to walk on the\n",
      "toe. As soon as it is able to do this a bandage is unnecessary. It is not\n",
      "advisable to turn the colt outside if there is any chance for the bandages\n",
      "to become wet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knuckling-over due to faulty conformation is difficult to correct. Light\n",
      "work and careful shoeing are the most valuable preventive measures in young\n",
      "horses. Sprains and injuries to the region of the fetlock should receive\n",
      "the necessary treatment. The treatment for contracted tendon is largely\n",
      "surgical and consists in sectioning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "INJURIES CAUSED BY INTERFERING.--Horses that have faulty action may strike\n",
      "the opposite fetlock with the moving foot, the inside of the opposite limb\n",
      "in the region of the knee, and the quarters of the front foot with the shoe\n",
      "of the hindfoot. It is very common for horses to \"brush\" the inside of the\n",
      "hind fetlock with the opposite foot when trotting, especially if tired.\n",
      "Interfering in the front feet is less common. Striking the inside of the\n",
      "region of the knee with the opposite foot or \"_speedy cutting_\" occurs in\n",
      "driving and speed horses. Both of the latter forms of interfering may be\n",
      "considered unsoundnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most _common cause_ of interfering is faulty conformation, such as\n",
      "narrowness of the chest or pelvis, faulty conformation of the limbs and\n",
      "irregularity in the action of the joints. Shoeing and the condition of the\n",
      "feet are also important factors. Animals that have a narrow chest or pelvis\n",
      "interfere because the legs are placed too closely together. Turning in of\n",
      "the knees or \"knock-kneed,\" winging in or out of the feet, or any other\n",
      "defective conformation of the limbs that tends to prevent the animal from\n",
      "moving the feet in line, lead to serious interfering. A wide-spreading\n",
      "hoof, an unbalanced condition of the foot and improper fitting of the shoes\n",
      "are common causes for interfering in horses that would otherwise move the\n",
      "feet in line. Debility from disease and overwork may cause the animal to\n",
      "interfere temporarily. An unbalanced gait and shortness of the body are the\n",
      "common causes for injuries to the quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "All degrees of injury to the part struck by the shoe or wall of the foot\n",
      "may be noted. Horses that interfere lightly, wear the hair off and produce\n",
      "slight abrasions of the skin on the inside of the fetlock. Sometimes the\n",
      "skin is bruised, inflamed or scarred. Injuries to the inside of the knee\n",
      "and quarter are the most serious. Lameness, inflammation of the periosteum\n",
      "and bony enlargement may result from \"speedy cutting.\" Deep wounds in the\n",
      "region of the heel or quarter may occur when a horse strikes this part with\n",
      "the shoe of the hindfoot in moving at a high rate of speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is largely preventive. No doubt many cases of interfering\n",
      "could be prevented by careful training and balancing of the foot when the\n",
      "animal is growing and developing. The feet of colts should be trimmed every\n",
      "three or four weeks. Interfering in the hindfeet may be stopped by noting\n",
      "the character of the animal's gait and the portion of the wall that strikes\n",
      "the part, and by practising intelligent methods of shoeing. Slight injuries\n",
      "should be treated by the application of antiseptic powders. The treatment\n",
      "for injuries to the periosteum is the same as that recommended for splints.\n",
      "As a last resort boots and button rings may be used for the purpose of\n",
      "preventing serious injury to that part which is struck by the foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "RING-BONE.--Chronic inflammation of the articulation between the first and\n",
      "second bones of the digit is termed ring-bone (Fig. 35). Not all ring-bones\n",
      "involve the articular surfaces. The periarticular, or false ring-bone, is a\n",
      "chronic inflammation of the bone near the articular surface. The bony\n",
      "enlargement varies in size. It may form a ring encircling the part, or it\n",
      "may be limited to the lateral surface of the joint. The bony enlargement\n",
      "may be so small as to be detected only by a careful examination. Ring-bone\n",
      "may occur on any of the feet, but it is said to be more common in the front\n",
      "feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Bones of digit, showing side bones and ring-bones,\n",
      "and normal bones of digit.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The predisposing cause_ of ring-bone is faulty conformation. Long, weak\n",
      "pasterns that are predisposed to strains, upright pasterns, especially if\n",
      "small, and exposed to concussion and jarring, and crooked feet that\n",
      "distribute the weight on the part irregularly are important factors in the\n",
      "production of ring-bones. The _external causes_ are sprains or any injury\n",
      "to the region. _Lameness_ is nearly always present. The degree of lameness\n",
      "varies, and does not depend altogether on the size of the bony enlargement.\n",
      "Large ring-bones interfere with the movement of the tendon. Lameness is\n",
      "most pronounced when weight is thrown on one foot, the later phase of the\n",
      "step being shortened and the pastern more upright. Some cases improve with\n",
      "rest, but the lameness returns when the animal is given hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in giving the necessary attention to\n",
      "the feet of young animals, by trimming the wall frequently and keeping the\n",
      "feet in balance and the careful selection of breeding stock. Resting the\n",
      "animal, keeping the foot that has the ring-bone on it in proper balance and\n",
      "counterirritation by means of blisters and cautery (searing) are important\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The foot of the horse as generally spoken of, includes\n",
      "the hoof and the structures that are enclosed by it (Fig. 36). It may be\n",
      "divided into three parts, the insensitive and sensitive structures and the\n",
      "bony core. The _insensitive foot_ or _hoof_ is divided into wall, sole,\n",
      "frog and bars. The _sensitive foot_ is divided into vascular tissue and\n",
      "elastic apparatus. The vascular tissue is in turn divided into coronary\n",
      "cushion, laminae and velvety tissue. The elastic apparatus is divided into\n",
      "plantar cushion and fibro-cartilages. The _bony core_ is formed by the\n",
      "navicular and third digital bones. The hoof and vascular tissue in turn\n",
      "enclose the elastic apparatus and bony core.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Photograph of a model of the foot: wall; sensitive\n",
      "tissue; plantar cushion, inferior dark portion, sole and frog; lateral\n",
      "cartilage; and pedal bone.]\n",
      "\n",
      "THE WALL forms that portion of the hoof seen when the foot rests on the\n",
      "ground (Fig. 37). It is covered by a thin layer of horny tissue, the\n",
      "_peripole,_ that coats over the wall and assists in preventing its drying\n",
      "out. On lifting the foot and examining its inferior surface, it is noticed\n",
      "that the wall at the heels is inflected under the foot and in a forward\n",
      "direction. This portion of the wall is termed the _bars._ Within the\n",
      "bearing margin of the wall and in front of the bars is a thick, concave,\n",
      "horny plate that forms the _sole._ At the heels and between the bars is a\n",
      "wedge-shaped mass of rather soft horny tissue that projects forward into\n",
      "the sole. This is the _foot pad_ or _horny frog._ It is divided into two\n",
      "lateral portions by a medium cleft.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE CORONARY CUSHION projects into the upper border of the wall. It is\n",
      "covered with vascular papillae which secrete the horny fibres that form the\n",
      "wall. The _vascular laminae_ are leaf-like projections, the sides of which\n",
      "are covered by secondary leaves. _Horny laminae_, arranged the same as\n",
      "vascular laminae, line the wall. These two structures are so firmly united\n",
      "that it is impossible to tear them apart without destroying the tissue. The\n",
      "_velvety tissue_ covers all of the inferior surface of the foot, with the\n",
      "exception of the bars. As the name indicates, its surface is covered by\n",
      "vascular papillae that resemble the ply on velvet. It is firmly united to\n",
      "the horny sole which it secretes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Foot showing neglect in trimming wall.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The lateral cartilages are attached to the posterior angles of the pedal\n",
      "bone. They are flattened from side to side, and the portion that projects\n",
      "above the coronary cushion may be felt by pressing on the skin that covers\n",
      "it. The _plantar cushion_ is a wedge-shaped piece of tissue formed by\n",
      "interlacing connective-tissue fibres and fat. It is limited on each side by\n",
      "the lateral cartilages. Its inferior face is moulded to the frog.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE BONY CORE formed by the last bone of the digit and the coffin bone was\n",
      "described briefly with the other foot bones. A very important bursa,\n",
      "because it is so frequently inflamed in coffin-joint lameness, facilitates\n",
      "the gliding of the flexor tendon over the navicular bone before it becomes\n",
      "attached to the inferior face of the pedal or digital bone.\n",
      "\n",
      "SIDE-BONES.--This is a chronic inflammation of the lateral cartilages of\n",
      "the foot that results in their ossification (Fig. 38). This unsoundness is\n",
      "common in heavy horses, especially if worked on city streets. The\n",
      "inflammation affects the cartilages of the front feet, rarely those of the\n",
      "hindfeet.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The hereditary tendency_ toward the development of side-bones is an\n",
      "important predisposing factor. It is not uncommon to meet with this\n",
      "unsoundness in young horses that have never been worked. Low, weak heels,\n",
      "flat, spreading feet, or any other faulty conformation of the foot are\n",
      "predisposing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 38.--A very large side bone.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The character of the work is an important _exciting cause._ Continuous work\n",
      "over paved streets, especially if the horse is shod with high-heeled shoes,\n",
      "increases the shock received by the elastic apparatus of the foot. This\n",
      "produces more or less irritation to the lateral cartilages, which may\n",
      "result in their complete ossification. Punctured wounds in the regions of\n",
      "the cartilage may cause it to become inflamed and changed to bone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _symptoms_ may be noted. Farm horses that have side-bones\n",
      "seldom show lameness. This is because they are worked on soft ground and\n",
      "not on a hard street or road. Driving and dray horses may step short with\n",
      "the front feet, or show a stilty action. This may disappear with exercise.\n",
      "The lameness is sometimes marked. The local diseased changes are the\n",
      "greatest help in the recognition of side-bones. Horses should not be passed\n",
      "as sound without making a careful examination of the lateral cartilages.\n",
      "This examination is made by pressure over the region of the cartilage with\n",
      "the thumb or fingers. This is for the purpose of testing its elasticity. If\n",
      "it feels rigid and rough, the cartilaginous tissue has been replaced by\n",
      "bony tissue, and the animal should be classed as unsound.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Horses with side-bones should not be\n",
      "bred. It is not advisable to use horses with side-bones on the road or city\n",
      "streets. Shoeing with rubber pads may help in overcoming the concussion and\n",
      "relieve the lameness. Sectioning the sensory nerves going to this portion\n",
      "of the foot is advisable in driving horses. Rest and counterirritation\n",
      "relieve the lameness for a short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "NAVICULAR DISEASE.--In navicular disease the bursa, flexor tendon, and\n",
      "navicular bone may become chronically inflamed. Because of the seat of the\n",
      "lameness, it is commonly known as \"coffin-joint\" lameness. This disease\n",
      "affects standard and thoroughbred horses more often than it does the\n",
      "coarser breeds. One or both front feet may be affected (Fig. 39).\n",
      "\n",
      "_Hereditary causes_ are largely responsible for navicular disease. The\n",
      "tendency toward this disease probably depends on such peculiarities of\n",
      "conformation as narrow, weak, high heels, long pasterns and too long a toe.\n",
      "The character of the work is an important factor. Hurried, rapid movements\n",
      "throw considerable strain on the navicular region, increasing the danger\n",
      "from injury. This is, no doubt, one reason for \"coffin-joint\" lameness\n",
      "being more common in driving and speed horses than in slow-going work\n",
      "animals. Rheumatic inflammation, bad shoeing and punctured wounds in the\n",
      "region of the bursa many cause it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 39.--A case of navicular disease involving one front\n",
      "foot. The diseased foot is the smaller.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The _first symptom_ usually noted is a tendency to stumble. When standing\n",
      "in the stable, the animal \"points\" or rests the diseased foot. Sometimes it\n",
      "rests the heel of the lame foot on the wall of the opposite foot. If both\n",
      "feet are affected, the animal may rest them alternately, or take a position\n",
      "with both feet well in front of the normal position. The inflamed\n",
      "structures are so covered by other tissues that it is difficult to detect\n",
      "the local inflammation, or cause the animal to flinch by applying pressure\n",
      "over the region. As the disease becomes more advanced, the lameness becomes\n",
      "permanent. The limb is carried forward stiffly and rapidly and the animal\n",
      "stumbles when travelling over rough ground. In time, because of the little\n",
      "weight thrown on the posterior portion of the foot, the quarters may become\n",
      "higher, contracted and more upright and the frog smaller. If one foot is\n",
      "diseased, it becomes smaller than the opposite foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _preventive measures_ may be recommended. We should not use\n",
      "animals having faulty conformation of the feet for breeding, because the\n",
      "offspring of such individuals have an inherent tendency toward navicular\n",
      "and other foot diseases. Animals that have \"coffin-joint\" lameness should\n",
      "be allowed to run in pasture as much as possible, because natural\n",
      "conditions help to keep down the inflammation and soreness and promote a\n",
      "more healthy condition of the foot. In shoeing the horse it is best to\n",
      "shorten the toe and raise the heel. It is advisable in the more favorable\n",
      "cases to cut the sensory nerves of the foot. This operation destroys the\n",
      "sensation in the foot, and should not be performed on feet with weak heels,\n",
      "or that are wide or spreading.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 40.--An improperly shod foot; note the manner in which\n",
      "the wall is cut away at the toe.]\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTRACTED QUARTERS.--This condition of the feet is characterized by the\n",
      "foot becoming narrow in its posterior portion. One or both of the quarters\n",
      "may be affected. It is principally observed in the forefeet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _causes_ of contraction of the foot may be classed as _predisposing_,\n",
      "_secondary_ and _exciting_. It may accompany chronic diseases of the foot,\n",
      "such as navicular disease and side-bones. Weak heels is the principal\n",
      "predisposing factor. Any condition that tends to prevent the hoof from\n",
      "taking up moisture, or causes it to lose moisture, may cause the horn to\n",
      "lose flexibility and contract. This is one of the reasons why horses that\n",
      "are worked continuously in cities, or used for driving, frequently develop\n",
      "contracted feet. Ill-fitting shoes, excessive rasping of the wall and bars,\n",
      "and allowing the shoes to stay on the foot for too long a time are\n",
      "responsible to a very large degree for this disorder of the foot (Fig. 40).\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _local symptoms_ may occur: The wall of the foot at the\n",
      "quarters may appear drawn in at its superior or inferior portion. Sometimes\n",
      "one or both quarters are perpendicular, or nearly so. The foot then appears\n",
      "too narrow at the heel, too elongated and less rounded than normal. The\n",
      "changes in the appearance of the inferior surface of the hoof vary. The\n",
      "changes here may be so slight that they are not noticed. In well advanced\n",
      "and neglected cases the arch of the sole is increased, the frog is narrow\n",
      "and atrophied and the bars high and perpendicular. Corns may accompany the\n",
      "contraction. The foot may feel feverish. The animal may manifest the pain\n",
      "in the feet when standing at rest by pointing and changing their position.\n",
      "When lameness is present, it may resemble that occurring in inflammation of\n",
      "lateral cartilages and navicular disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Preventive treatment_ is of the greatest importance. This consists in\n",
      "giving the feet an opportunity to take up moisture when they are exposed to\n",
      "abnormal conditions and become feverish. Under such conditions, it is\n",
      "advisable to occasionally remove the shoes and turn the animal into a\n",
      "pasture or lot. It is best to do this in the fall or winter when the ground\n",
      "is wet. If this can not be practised, the shoes should be removed and a\n",
      "poultice of ground flaxseed and bran, equal parts, applied to the feet for\n",
      "a period of eight or ten hours, daily for a week or two. A plank trough six\n",
      "inches deep, two feet wide and as long as the stall is wide may be filled\n",
      "with a stiff clay, and the horse made to stand with its front feet in the\n",
      "clay bath for ten or twelve hours daily. When grooming the horse, the foot\n",
      "should be cleaned with a foot-hook and washed with clean water. Hoof\n",
      "ointments should be avoided so far as possible. The importance of fitting\n",
      "the shoe to the foot, avoiding the too free use of the rasp and hoof knife\n",
      "and resetting or changing the shoe when necessary can not be overestimated.\n",
      "Shoeing the animal with a special shoe is sometimes necessary. It is not\n",
      "advisable to attempt the forcible expansion of the quarters. Lowering the\n",
      "heels by careful trimming of the wall and sole and permitting frog pressure\n",
      "may be all the special attention required.\n",
      "\n",
      "SAND-CRACK.--A fissure in the wall of the foot running in the same\n",
      "direction as the horny fibres, or a seam in the wall resulting from the\n",
      "healing of the fissure is termed sand-crack. The position and extent of the\n",
      "fissure or seam vary. It may involve the wall of the _toe_ (toe-crack)\n",
      "(Fig. 41) or _quarter_ (quarter-crack) (Fig. 42). It is _superficial_ or\n",
      "_deep_, according to the thickness of the wall involved; _complete_ or\n",
      "_incomplete_, depending on whether it extends from the bearing margin of\n",
      "the wall to the coronary band or only a portion of the distance; _simple_,\n",
      "when the horny tissue only is involved; and _complicated_, when the\n",
      "sensitive tissue beneath becomes injured and inflamed. Cracks of long\n",
      "standing usually have thick, rough margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ of this unsoundness are poor quality of horn, improper care\n",
      "and injuries. Sand-cracks commonly occur in hoofs that are dry and brittle\n",
      "and have thin walls. In young horses incomplete cracks due to the wall\n",
      "becoming long and breaking off in large pieces are common. Unequal\n",
      "distribution of weight, the result of unskilled shoeing, or any other\n",
      "condition that may cause the foot to become unbalanced, using the foot rasp\n",
      "too freely, and such diseases as quittor, corns and contracted quarters\n",
      "subject the animal to this form of unsoundness. Any injury to the coronary\n",
      "cushion that secretes the fibres of the horny wall may result in either\n",
      "toe- or quarter-crack. Treads and barb-wire cuts are common injuries to the\n",
      "region of the coronet.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in preserving a healthy condition of\n",
      "the horn by giving the foot the necessary care and attention in the way of\n",
      "proper trimming and shoeing, and providing it with the necessary moisture\n",
      "by means of foot-baths, wet clay and poultices. Quarter-cracks respond to\n",
      "treatment more quickly than toe-cracks. The treatment is practically the\n",
      "same for both. This consists in preventing motion in the margins of the\n",
      "fissure so far as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Toe-cracks.]\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Quarter-crack caused by barb-wire cut.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment for fissures_ in the region of the toe and quarter is as\n",
      "follows: The wall should be cut away along the margins of the crack until\n",
      "it is quite thin; and extra nail holes should be made in the shoe, and a\n",
      "nail driven into the bearing margin of the wall a little to each side of\n",
      "the fissure. The wall at the toe should be shortened and the toe of the\n",
      "shoe rolled if the animal's work permits the use of this kind of a shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The margins of a quarter-crack and the wall just posterior and below it\n",
      "should be cut away until quite thin. The bearing margin should then be\n",
      "trimmed so that it does not rest on the shoe. A bar shoe that does not\n",
      "press on the frog may be used. Light blisters to the region of the coronet\n",
      "help in stimulating the growth of the horn. Rest is advisable.\n",
      "\n",
      "CORNS.--This term is applied to injuries to the foot caused by bruises or\n",
      "continuous pressure to the posterior portion of the sole. This condition is\n",
      "common in the forefeet.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The predisposing causes_ are faulty conformation that favors pressure from\n",
      "the shoe on the sole between the bars and wall and weak heels. Corns are\n",
      "commonly met with in feet having contracted quarters. The principal\n",
      "_external causes_ are wrong methods of shoeing and allowing the shoes to\n",
      "remain on the feet for too long a period.\n",
      "\n",
      "_A common symptom_ of corns is lameness. In order to relieve the pressure\n",
      "over the inflamed part, the animal stands with the foot slightly flexed at\n",
      "the fetlock. The lameness is not characteristic. It is only by a local\n",
      "examination of the foot, made by pressing on the sole or cutting away the\n",
      "horn, that we are able to form a positive diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "We describe the _diseased changes_ by using the terms _dry_, _moist_ and\n",
      "_suppurative corns_. In the _dry corn_ we find the horn stained and\n",
      "infiltrated with blood. In the _moist corn_ the hoof may be colored the\n",
      "same as in the former, but in addition there is a space between the\n",
      "vascular and horny tissue that is filled with a serous-like fluid. If this\n",
      "collection of fluid becomes infected with pus organisms and is changed to\n",
      "pus, it is then termed a _suppurative corn_. Sometimes the pus pushes its\n",
      "way upward and backward between the sensitive laminae and the wall, and\n",
      "makes its appearance at the margin of the coronary band in the region of\n",
      "the quarters or heels. This usually occurs when the tissues beneath the\n",
      "horny frog become bruised or the sensitive tissue pricked by a nail. It is\n",
      "commonly termed \"gravelled.\" Pus rarely breaks through the thick horny\n",
      "tissue, but follows the wall and breaks through the skin where it meets\n",
      "with the least resistance. Corns may be considered a serious unsoundness in\n",
      "driving horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Trimming the foot and fitting the\n",
      "shoe properly are important preventive measures. The practice of cutting\n",
      "away the bars and sole or \"opening up the heels,\" as it is commonly termed,\n",
      "should be condemned. This method of trimming the foot instead of preventing\n",
      "corns is a very common factor in producing them. The shoe should not be too\n",
      "short or too narrow. It should follow the outline of the wall and rest\n",
      "evenly on its bearing margin. If this is practised, weakening the wall by\n",
      "cutting off that portion allowed to project beyond the shoe is unnecessary.\n",
      "Feet that have low heels and large, prominent frogs should be shod with\n",
      "shoes thick at the heels. The best line of treatment for a horse that is\n",
      "subject to corns is to remove the shoes and allow the animal to run in a\n",
      "pasture. If this is impossible, poulticing the feet or standing the animal\n",
      "in moist clay will help in relieving the soreness. Excessive cutting away\n",
      "of the horny sole is contra-indicated. Suppurative corns should be given\n",
      "proper drainage and treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "LAMINITIS, \"FOUNDER.\"--This is an inflammation of the sensitive or vascular\n",
      "stricture of the foot. The inflammation may be acute, subacute or chronic.\n",
      "Stockmen frequently use a classification for laminitis based on the causes.\n",
      "Feed, road and water founder are common terms used in speaking of this\n",
      "disease. The inflammation is usually limited to the front feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ of laminitis are overfeeding, sudden changes in the feed,\n",
      "drinking a large quantity of water when the animal is overheated,\n",
      "overexertion, exhaustion and chilling of the body by standing the animal in\n",
      "a cold draft. It may be associated with such diseases as rheumatism,\n",
      "influenza and colic.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different forms of the disease. Pain is the most\n",
      "characteristic symptom. The sensitive or vascular structure of the foot has\n",
      "an abundant supply of sensory nerves, and, as it is situated between the\n",
      "hoof and the bony core, the pressure and pain resulting from the\n",
      "inflammation are severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the _acute form_ general symptoms are manifested. The appetite is\n",
      "impaired, the body temperature elevated and the pulse beats and\n",
      "respirations quickened. If the inflammation is severe, the animal prefers\n",
      "to lie down. This is especially true if all four feet are inflamed. In most\n",
      "cases the horse stands with the forefeet well forward and the hind feet in\n",
      "front of their normal position and under the body. The affected feet are\n",
      "feverish and very sensitive to jarring or pressure. Moving about increases\n",
      "the pain in the feet, and it may be very difficult to make the animal step\n",
      "about the stall.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the _subacute form_ the symptoms are less severe. The irregularity in\n",
      "the gait is especially noticeable when the animal is turned quickly. The\n",
      "local symptoms are less marked than in the acute form and the general\n",
      "symptoms may be absent.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The chronic form_ is characterized by changes in the shape and appearance\n",
      "of the hoofs (Fig. 43). The wall shows prominent ridges or rings, the toe\n",
      "may be concave, thick and long and the sole less arched than usual, or\n",
      "convex. The degree of lameness varies. It is more noticeable when the horse\n",
      "is moved over a hard roadway than if moved over soft ground. One attack of\n",
      "laminitis may predispose the animal to a second attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The prognosis_ depends on the character of the inflammation and the\n",
      "promptness and thoroughness of the treatment. Acute laminitis may respond\n",
      "to prompt, careful treatment in from ten to fourteen days. Subacute\n",
      "laminitis responds readily to treatment. The prognosis is least favorable\n",
      "in the chronic form.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ is very important. Dietetic causes are\n",
      "responsible for a large percentage of the cases of this disease. Horses\n",
      "that are accustomed to being fed and watered at irregular periods and after\n",
      "severe or unusual exercise seem to be able to stand this treatment better\n",
      "than animals that are more carefully cared for, but even this class of\n",
      "animals do not always escape injury. Stockmen should realize the danger of\n",
      "producing an inflammation of the feet by feeding grain and giving cold\n",
      "water to horses immediately after severe exercise. Overfeeding should also\n",
      "be avoided. Careful nursing may prevent the occurrence of laminitis as a\n",
      "complication of other diseases.\n",

      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ of the inflammation is as follows: The removal of the shoes\n",
      "and the necessary trimming of the foot should be practised early in the\n",
      "inflammation; the horse should be placed in a roomy box-stall that is well\n",
      "bedded with cut straw; during the cool weather it may be necessary to\n",

      "the stall should be darkened; in serious cases, and when the animal is\n",
      "heavy, it may be advisable to use a sling; hot water fomentations are to be\n",
      "preferred; the patient may be stood in a tub of hot water or heavy woollen\n",
      "bandages that have been dipped in hot water and wrung, out as dry as\n",
      "possible may be applied to the feet; the temperature of the water should be\n",
      "no hotter than can be comfortably borne with the hands; the results of this\n",
      "treatment depend on the faithfulness with which it is carried out; a\n",
      "poultice of ground flaxseed should be applied to the foot at night, or\n",

      "until the acute inflammation has subsided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the animal is inclined to eat, it should be fed very little roughness\n",
      "and grain. Soft feeds are to be preferred, and one quart of linseed oil\n",
      "given as a physic. After a period of from ten days to three weeks,\n",
      "depending on the tenderness of the feet, the wall at the toe should be\n",
      "shortened, the sole trimmed if necessary, flat shoes rolled at the toe\n",
      "placed on the feet, and the animal allowed to exercise a short time each\n",
      "day in a lot or pasture. As the hoof grows rapidly, it is necessary to trim\n",

      "In making an _examination_ of these parts the examiner should see that the\n",
      "horse is standing squarely on its feet, and then compare the conformation\n",

      "LUXATION OF THE PATELLA, \"Stifle Out.\"--This is a common accident in horses\n",
      "and mules. Young, immature animals are more prone to displacement of the\n",
      "patella than when mature. The displacement is usually upward or outward.\n",
      "Outward displacement is comparatively rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ of \"stifle out\" may be described as follows: The patella or\n",
      "knee-cap rests on a pulley-like articular surface belonging to the inferior\n",
      "extremity of the thigh-bone. The external lip of this articular surface is\n",
      "smaller than the internal lip. The patella is held in place from above by\n",
      "the heavy muscles of the anterior region of the thigh, and from below, by\n",
      "straight ligaments that attach it to the leg-bone. If the retaining\n",
      "structures mentioned become relaxed, the patella may, when the limb is\n",
      "extended, become so displaced as to rest on the superior portion of the\n",
      "external lip. Laxness of the muscles and ligaments in young animals is a\n",
      "predisposing factor. Hard work that tires the muscles and causes them to\n",
      "become relaxed, strains, unusual movements, as kicking in the stable and\n",
      "slipping, may cause this accident. Congenital displacement results from\n",
      "imperfect development of the external lip of the trochlea. Such a deformity\n",
      "subjects the animal to frequent luxations.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms may vary_. The displacement may be first noticed when the\n",
      "horse is backed out of the stall or turned quickly. A slight \"hitch\" in the\n",
      "movement of the limb is noted, that is followed by more noticeable flexion\n",
      "of the hock than normal. In case the luxation is more permanent, the horse\n",
      "stands quietly with the affected leg held stiffly and extended backward.\n",
      "When made to move forward, it hops on the well leg and carries the affected\n",
      "one, or drags it on the toe. If both limbs are affected, the animal is\n",
      "unable to move. The inability to move the limb is due to the patella\n",
      "resting on the external lip of the pulley surface, and a locking of the\n",
      "stifle- and hock-joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "This accident is annoying, and in case the horse is subject to it should be\n",
      "considered an unsoundness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _treatment_ may be recommended: The luxation may be reduced\n",
      "in the large majority of cases by backing or turning the animal. If this\n",
      "does not reduce the displacement, a collar should be placed on the animal,\n",
      "and a hobble strap fastened to the pastern of the involved limb. One end of\n",
      "a long rope is tied to the collar, passed backward between the front limbs,\n",
      "through a ring in the hobble and back over the outside of the shoulder and\n",
      "under the collar. While an attendant pulls the limb a little forward with\n",
      "the rope, the operator takes hold of the foot and attempts to flex the\n",
      "limb, at the same time pushing inward on the patella. After reducing the\n",
      "luxation it is advisable to tie the rope to the collar, so that the limb is\n",
      "carried forward. This prevents the animal from throwing weight on the foot.\n",
      "It may be advisable to tie the animal so that it can not lie down, if the\n",
      "foot is to be left hobbled for a few days. A fly blister should be applied\n",

      "caused by slipping, turning quickly, rearing, pulling heavy loads and\n",
      "kicks. Horses three or four years of age if given work that favors hock\n",
      "strain, such as excavating cellars, may develop a spavin.\n",

      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ or lameness are more characteristic than in most diseases of\n",
      "the limb. At the very beginning of the inflammation, and sometimes for\n",
      "several months afterward, the lameness is intermittent and disappears with\n",
      "exercise. After a time it is permanent. It is characterized by a stiffness\n",
      "of the hock. The extension of the hock is incomplete, the step is short and\n",
      "quick, the animal \"goes on its toe\" and the wall or shoe at the toe shows\n",
      "considerable wear. Because of the stiffness in the hock the animal raises\n",
      "the quarter when the limb is carried forward. Turning toward the well side\n",
      "may increase the lameness. The _spavin test_ may be of value in diagnosing\n",
      "lameness. This consists in picking up the foot and holding the hock in a\n",
      "flexed position for a few minutes. The foot is then dropped to the ground\n",
      "and the animal moved off at a brisk trot. If the lameness is more marked,\n",
      "it indicates that the seat is in the region of the hock. This test is of\n",
      "greatest value in young animals. The bony enlargement can usually be seen\n",
      "best if the examiner stands in front and to one side of the animal. The\n",
      "hock should be observed from directly behind as well. The hocks of both\n",
      "limbs should be compared, and the general conformations of the other joints\n",
      "as well. This may prevent the examiner from mistaking rough hocks for\n",
      "spavin enlargements or \"a pair\" of spavins for rough hocks. A bony\n",
      "enlargement does not always accompany the lameness, and a spavin may be\n",
      "present without the horse going noticeably lame.\n",

      "\n",
      "The _following symptoms_ may be noted: Lameness is not a common symptom of\n",
      "bog spavin. If there is inflammation present or the articulation is\n",
      "injured, lameness occurs. The soft swelling that characterizes the bog\n",
      "spavin is most prominent toward the inside and front of the region. In the\n",
      "upper portion or hollow of the hock, and on the inside and outside, there\n",
      "may be a second enlargement. Smaller enlargements may be present in other\n",
      "regions. All of the swellings feel soft, and pressure on any one of them\n",
      "moves the fluid present in the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is directed at the removal of the lameness. Acute\n",
      "inflammation resulting from spavin may be relieved by cold applications and\n",
      "rest. Chronic lameness should be given the same treatment as recommended\n",
      "for bone spavin. The enlargement can be successfully removed in growing\n",
      "colts by the repeated application of mild blisters. It may be necessary to\n",
      "continue the treatment for several months. The removal of the enlargement\n",

      "CAPPED HOCK.--All swellings on the point of the hock are termed \"capped\n",

      "subcutaneous bursa, the tendon, or the synovial bursa or sack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capped hock is _caused_ by the animal kicking in the stall or in harness,\n",
      "shipping in freight cars and lack of bedding in the stall. Unless the\n",
      "deeper structures are bruised and inflamed the animal shows no lameness.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The character_ of the enlargement varies. When the injury is superficial,\n",
      "the swelling feels firm, or pits on pressure. Later it may become more firm\n",
      "and feel like a loose, thickened, fibrous cap for the hock. Soft,\n",
      "fluctuating swellings are due to an inflammation of the bursa. Recent\n",

      "application of cold and rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the inflammation has subsided tincture of iodine or blisters may be\n",
      "applied. The treatment of bursal enlargements is surgical. This consists in\n",
      "opening the bursa, destroying the lining membrane of the cavity and\n",
      "treating the part daily until healed. The operation must be performed\n",
      "carefully, as there is danger of infection with irritating organisms. The\n",
      "animal should be given complete rest until the part is healed. Tincture of\n",
      "iodine may be applied to the enlargement that may remain after healing has\n",

      "jaw and teeth are the overshot or parrot-mouth, the undershot or\n",
      "lantern-jaw, and the scissor-mouth. These different deformities result in\n",
      "unequal wear on the table surfaces of the incisors and molars. In both the\n",
      "overshot and undershot jaws, the incisor teeth become abnormally long. In\n",
      "the _parrot-mouth_, the wear occurs on the posterior face of the superior\n",
      "and the anterior face of the inferior incisors, the teeth becoming worn to\n",
      "rather a sharp edge, depending on the degree of the deformity. In the\n",
      "_lantern-jaw_, the wear occurs on the posterior face of the lower and the\n",
      "anterior face of the superior row of incisors, the teeth taking on somewhat\n",
      "the same shape as the parrot-mouth. The greater the deformity and the older\n",
      "the horse becomes, the more difficult it is for the animal to feed or\n",
      "graze on pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all horses, the two rows of molar teeth are wider apart in the superior\n",
      "than in the inferior jaw. This results in the external border of the tables\n",
      "of the superior row of molars becoming longer, or projecting further\n",
      "downward than the internal border. The wear on the table surfaces of the\n",
      "inferior row of molars is just the opposite of the superior row. In the\n",
      "_scissor-mouth_ the wear takes place largely on the internal face of the\n",
      "superior and the external face of the inferior row of molars. The teeth\n",
      "become worn to more or less of a blunt cutting edge, and after a time the\n",
      "molars come together somewhat like the jaws of a pair of scissors. A horse\n",
      "with a badly deformed scissor-mouth is unable to grind the feed, and unless\n",
      "given special care, suffers severely from innutrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ of deformed mouths consists in removing the irregular or\n",
      "unworn portion of the teeth by means of the tooth float and cutters. This\n",
      "attention should be given early before the free portion of the tooth has\n",
      "become excessively long and irregular. This should be followed by dressing\n",
      "the teeth every six or twelve months.\n",
      "\n",
      "SHARP LATERAL BORDERS ON THE MOLAR TEETH.--This is a very common condition\n",
      "in horses. The external border of the superior and the internal border of\n",
      "the inferior row of molars wear away slowly, and sometimes become quite\n",
      "sharp. This is objectionable because the sharp points lacerate the mucous\n",
      "membrane of the cheek and tongue, and the mastication of the feed is\n",
      "seriously interfered with.\n",
      "\n",
      "This condition is _caused_ by an excessive difference in the width of the\n",
      "jaws, unusually prominent ridges of enamel on the external face of the\n",
      "superior molars, and any conditions that may limit the movements of the\n",
      "jaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _symptoms_ may be noted. The animal has difficulty in\n",
      "masticating the feed because of injury to the cheeks or tongue by the sharp\n",
      "points of enamel. This condition may be indicated by holding the head to\n",
      "one side. Salivation is usually present. Acute indigestion and innutrition\n",
      "may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "By examining the teeth, their condition can be determined. The sharp\n",
      "borders may be removed by dressing or floating the teeth. It is advisable\n",
      "in the majority of horses to float the teeth at least once in every twelve\n",
      "months.\n",
      "\n",
      "IRREGULARITIES IN THE TABLE SURFACE OF THE MOLAR TEETH.--Horses eight years\n",
      "of age or older frequently have irregular molars (Fig. 56). This is due\n",
      "very largely to the difference in the quality of the teeth. The harder\n",
      "molars do not wear off as rapidly as the softer ones. This results in the\n",
      "table surfaces of the rows of molars becoming wavy or step-like in outline.\n",
      "Sometimes the first or sixth molar overhangs or projects beyond the\n",
      "corresponding tooth of the opposite jaw. When this occurs, the over-hanging\n",
      "portion may become long and sharp. A molar tooth becomes excessively long\n",
      "if the opposite one is decayed or removed.\n",

      "blood-flow becoming entirely suspended; (3) following the retardation or\n",
      "suspension of the blood stream, white blood-corpuscles accumulate along the\n",
      "walls of the small veins and capillaries; (4) white and red\n",
      "blood-corpuscles migrate from the vessels into the neighboring tissue, and\n",
      "blood-serum transudes through the walls of the vessels, forming the\n",
      "inflammatory swellings. The red blood-cells do not escape from the\n",
      "blood-vessels in any numbers unless the walls of the blood-vessels become\n",
      "injured or badly diseased.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes of inflammation_ may be grouped under the following heads:\n",
      "mechanical, chemical, thermic and infectious. The _mechanical_ or\n",
      "_traumatic causes_ commonly produce inflammation in domestic animals. These\n",
      "are kicks, strains of tendons, ligaments or muscles and wounds.\n",
      "Inflammation originating from injuries very frequently changes to an\n",
      "infectious form, through the infection of the part by bacteria. Bruised\n",
      "tissue may become infected with pus-producing organisms, and an abscess or\n",
      "local swelling form. All accidental wounds in domestic animals become more\n",
      "or less infected by irritating microorganisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _symptoms_ occur in local inflammation. Increased heat in the\n",
      "part is an important symptom. It is due to the increased blood-flow to the\n",
      "part. Because of the pigmented, hairy skin of domestic animals, redness is\n",
      "of little value in locating superficial inflammation. Swelling is a\n",
      "valuable local symptom. It is produced by the inflammatory exudates. Pain\n",

      "nerves, and when it becomes inflamed and swollen, the tissues are subject\n",
      "to severe pressure and the pain is severe. Inflammation of a tendon results\n",
      "in lameness; of the udder, in suspension of milk secretions; and of the\n",
      "stomach by interference with digestion of the feed. Such symptoms may be\n",
      "grouped under the head of disturbed functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The character of an inflammation_ is largely modified by the nature of the\n",
      "tissue in which it occurs. A serous inflammation is characterized by\n",
      "serous, watery exudates. This form occurs in the serous membranes, mucous\n",
      "membranes and skin. Blisters on the skin and inflammation of bursae (capped\n",
      "hock and shoe boil) are examples of this type. Sero-fibrinous\n",
      "inflammations, such as occur in pleurisy and peritonitis, are common.\n",
      "Chronic inflammation commonly results in new formations of tissue, and it\n",
      "is named according to the character of the new tissue formed, as ossifying,\n",
      "adhesive, and fibrous inflammation. Pus-forming bacteria produce\n",
      "suppurative inflammation. Such diseases as tuberculosis, glanders and\n",
      "hog-cholera are specific inflammations. Specific infectious diseases may be\n",
      "classed as generalized inflammation, as they usually involve the entire\n",
      "body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflammation terminates in resolution when the serum is reabsorbed by the\n",
      "blood-vessels and lymphatics, the living blood-cells find their way back\n",
      "into the circulation and the dead cells disintegrate and are taken up by\n",
      "the vessels. The time required for the tissues to return to the normal\n",
      "varies from a few hours to several weeks. An acute inflammation may end in\n",
      "the chronic form. This may then terminate in new formations, such as\n",
      "adhesions, fibrous thickenings and bony enlargements. Severe inflammation,\n",
      "especially if localized and superficial, may result in death of the part or\n",
      "gangrene.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _treatment_ is recommended: The cause of the irritation to\n",
      "the tissue must be removed. It is very essential that the part be rested.\n",
      "The necessary rest may be obtained in different ways. Inflamed tendons,\n",
      "ligaments, and muscles may be rested by placing the animal in a sling,\n",
      "standing it in a stall, or fixing the part with bandages. Rest of the\n",
      "stomach or intestinal tract may be obtained by feeding a light diet, or\n",
      "withholding all feed. Comfortable quarters, special care and dieting the\n",
      "animal are important factors in the treatment of inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agents used in the treatment of superficial and localized inflammation\n",
      "are _heat, cold, massage_ and _counterirritation_. _Heat_ is indicated in\n",
      "all inflammations, excepting when of bacterial origin. It stimulates the\n",
      "circulation and reabsorption of the inflammatory exudates, and by relaxing\n",
      "the tissues helps greatly in relieving pain. _Cold_ is more effective in\n",
      "the highly acute and septic (suppurative) inflammation. Its action consists\n",
      "principally in the contraction of the dilated blood-vessels. Continuous\n",
      "irrigation of the part with cold water is the most satisfactory method of\n",
      "applying cold. _Massage_ is a very important method of treating superficial\n",
      "inflammation. Mild, stimulating liniments are usually used in connection\n",
      "with hand-rubbing or friction. Chronic inflammation is usually treated with\n",
      "_counterirritants._ Blistering and firing are the most important methods\n",
      "of treatment. Such counterirritation makes possible the absorption of the\n",
      "inflammatory exudates by changing the chronic inflammation to the acute\n",
      "form.\n",
      "\n",
      "WOUNDS.--A wound, in the restricted sense that the term is commonly used,\n",
      "includes only such injuries that are accompanied by breaks or divisions of\n",
      "the skin and mucous membrane. It is usually an open, hemorrhagic injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the tissues are severed by a sharp instrument and the edges of the wound\n",
      "are smooth, it is classed as an _incised_ or _clean-cut wound_. This class\n",
      "is not commonly met with in domestic animals outside of operative wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tissues are torn irregularly, the injury is classed as a\n",
      "_lacerated wound_. A barb-wire cut is the best example of this class.\n",
      "\n",
      "A _contused wound_ is an injury caused by a blunt object. Such injuries may\n",
      "be divided into superficial and deep. Superficial-contused wounds may be an\n",
      "abrasion to the skin or mucous surface. Deep-contused wounds may be\n",
      "followed by loss of tissue or sloughing, and may present irregular, swollen\n",
      "margins. Such injuries are commonly caused by kicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Punctured wounds_ are many times deeper than the width of the opening or\n",
      "break in the skin or mucous membrane. This class is produced by sharp\n",
      "objects, such as nails, splinters of wood, and forks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, wounds are given special names, as gun-shot, poisoned, and open\n",
      "joint, depending on the nature of the cause and region involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bleeding or hemorrhage is the most constant symptom. The degree of\n",
      "hemorrhage depends on the kind, number and size of the blood-vessels\n",
      "severed. In arterial hemorrhage, the blood is bright red and spurts from\n",
      "the mouth of the cut vessel. In venous hemorrhage, the blood is darker and\n",
      "flows in a continuous stream. In abrasions and superficial wounds capillary\n",
      "hemorrhage occurs. Death may follow severe hemorrhage. Weak pulse,\n",
      "general weakness, vertigo, loss of consciousness and death may result if\n",
      "one-third of the total quantity of blood is lost. Unthriftiness and general\n",
      "debility may follow the loss of a less quantity of blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _symptoms_ may be noted in the different kinds of wounds: The\n",
      "sensitiveness to the pain resulting from accidental or operative wounds\n",
      "varies in the different individuals and species, and in the kind of tissue\n",
      "injured. Injuries to the foot, periosteum, skin and mucous membrane are\n",
      "more painful than are injuries to cartilages and tendons. The appearance of\n",
      "the wound varies in the different regions and the different tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the tissues are badly torn or bruised, swelling and sloughing may occur.\n",
      "If the wound is transverse to the muscular fibres, it gaps more than when\n",
      "parallel to the muscle. When infected by irritating organisms, open and\n",
      "punctured wounds (Fig. 58) become badly swollen, discharge pus freely and\n",
      "heal slowly with excessive granulations. Wounds involving tendons, bursae\n",
      "and closed articulations become swollen and discharge synovia. Wounds\n",
      "involving muscles, tendons and bursae usually cause lameness, and when\n",
      "involving a special organ, interfere with, or destroy, its function.\n",
      "Extensive or serious wounds may be followed by loss of appetite. An\n",
      "abnormal body temperature and other symptoms characteristic of the\n",
      "different forms of blood poisoning may follow infection of the injured\n",
      "tissues by certain germs.\n",

      "The rapidity with which wounds heal depends upon the kind of tissue injured\n",
      "and the amount to be replaced, the degree of motion in the part, the kind\n",
      "and degree of infection and irritation and the general condition of the\n",
      "animal. In general, skin and muscles heal rapidly, tendons slowly,\n",
      "cartilages unsatisfactorily and nerve tissue very slowly. Healing is\n",
      "greatly interfered with by movement of the part (Fig. 59). The more nearly\n",
      "the part can be fixed or rested, the more quickly and satisfactorily does\n",
      "healing occur. Irritation by biting, nibbling, licking, bandaging, wrong\n",
      "methods of treatment and filth retard healing and may result in serious\n",
      "wound complications. An animal in poor physical condition, or one kept\n",

      "WOUND HEALING.--The following forms of healing commonly occur in wounds:\n",
      "First and second intention; under a scab, and by abnormal granulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Healing by first intention_ occurs when the wound is clean cut and there\n",
      "is very little destruction of tissue, and when there is no suppuration or\n",
      "pus formation. The blood and wound secretions cause the edges of the wound\n",
      "to adhere. After a few days or a week the union becomes firm. Very little\n",
      "scar tissue is necessary in this form of healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Healing by second intention_ is characterized by pus formation and\n",
      "granulation tissue. After the first day, the surface of the wound may be\n",
      "more or less covered by red, granular-like tissue. Later this granular\n",
      "appearance is modified by an accumulation of creamy pus and swelling of the\n",
      "part, and finally scab formation and contraction of the new scar tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abrasions and superficial wounds usually _heal under a scab_. The scab is\n",
      "formed by the blood and wound secretions. This protects the surface of the\n",
      "wound until finally the destroyed tissue is replaced by the granulations,\n",
      "and the skin surface is restored.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Abnormal granulation_ is not an uncommon form of healing in domestic\n",
      "animals. Mechanical and bacterial irritation causes the injured tissue to\n",
      "become swollen and inflamed. In such a wound, excessive and rapid\n",
      "granulation occurs, the new tissue piling up over the cut surfaces and\n",
      "appearing red and uneven. This is termed excessive granulation or \"proud\n",
      "flesh.\" This tissue may refuse to \"heal over,\" or the scar may be large,\n",
      "prominent and painful. Abnormal tissue (horny or tumor-like) may sometimes\n",
      "form.\n",
      "\n",
      "WOUND TREATMENT.--Wounds in domestic animals are frequently allowed to heal\n",
      "without special care or treatment. This is unfortunate. The careful and\n",
      "intelligent treatment of wounds would greatly decrease the loss resulting\n",
      "from this class of injuries. The method of treatment varies in the\n",
      "different kinds of wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The first step_ in the treatment is to _check the haemorrhage_. Heat,\n",
      "ligation, pressure and torsion are the different methods recommended.\n",
      "Bathing the wound with hot water (115\\260-120\\260 F.) is a satisfactory\n",
      "method of controlling haemorrhage from small blood-vessels. Ligation and\n",
      "torsion of the cut end of large blood-vessels should be practised.\n",
      "Pressure over the surface of the wound is the most convenient method of\n",
      "Controlling haemorrhage in most cases. Whenever possible, the part should\n",
      "be bandaged heavily with clean cheese cloth or muslin. Before applying\n",
      "the bandage, it is advisable to cover the wound with a piece of sterile\n",
      "absorbent cotton that is well dusted with boric acid. Hemorrhage from\n",
      "wounds that cannot be bandaged may be temporarily stopped by pressure\n",
      "with the hand, or, better, by packing the wound with absorbent cotton\n",
      "and holding this in place with sutures. This should be left in place for\n",
      "a period of twelve or thirty-six hours, depending on the extent of the\n",
      "haemorrhage and character of the wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is the _preparation of the wound for healing._ The injured\n",
      "tissues should be carefully examined for foreign bodies such as hair, dirt,\n",
      "gravel, slivers of wood and nails. The hair along the margins of the wound\n",
      "should be trimmed, and all tissue that is so torn and detached as to\n",
      "interfere with healing cut away. Drainage for the wound secretions and pus\n",
      "should be provided. The advisability of suturing the wound depends on its\n",
      "character and location. A contused-lacerated wound should not be closed\n",
      "with sutures unless it is clean and shows no evidence of sloughing. A badly\n",
      "infected wound should be left open unless satisfactory drainage for the pus\n",
      "and wound secretions can be provided. Wounds across the muscle and in parts\n",
      "that are quite movable should not be sutured.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The after-treatment_ consists in keeping the animal quiet, if the wound is\n",
      "in a part that is quite movable, and preventing it from biting, licking or\n",
      "nibbling the injury. Wounds in the region of the foot become irritated with\n",
      "dirt and by rubbing against weeds and grass. This makes it advisable to\n",
      "keep the animal in a clean stall until healing is well advanced. Local\n",
      "treatment consists in keeping the wound clean by washing the part daily, or\n",
      "twice daily, with a one per cent water solution of a cresol disinfectant.\n",
      "Liquor cresolis compositus may be used. It is sometimes advisable to\n",
      "protect the granulating surface against irritation by dusting it over with\n",
      "a non-irritating antiseptic powder, or applying a mixture of carbolic acid\n",
      "one part and glycerine twelve parts. After the wound shows healthy\n",
      "granulations longer intervals should lapse between treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In poorly cared for, and badly infected wounds, the part may become badly\n",
      "swollen, the granulations pile up and the wound refuse to \"heal over.\" It\n",
      "may be advisable in such cases to cut away the excessive granulations and\n",
      "stop the haemorrhage by cauterization with a red-hot iron, or by\n",
      "compression. Unhealthy granulations may be kept down by applying caustic\n",
      "occasionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "ABSCESS.--This is an accumulation of pus in the tissues. It may be due to a\n",
      "severe bruise or contusion that is followed by the infection of the part\n",
      "with some of the pus-producing bacteria. Abscesses occur in certain\n",
      "infectious diseases. In strangles, the disease-producing organism may be\n",
      "carried to different regions of the body by the circulatory vessels. This\n",
      "may result in a number of abscesses forming in the different body tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following _forms of abscess_ are recognized: hot and cold, superficial\n",
      "and deep, simple and multiple. The hot is the acute, and the cold the\n",
      "chronic abscess. The terms superficial and deep allude to the relative\n",
      "position of the abscess, and simple and multiple to the number present.\n",
      "\n",
      "An abscess may first appear as a hot, painful swelling. If superficial, the\n",
      "skin feels tense and the contents fluctuate when pressed on. Later the\n",
      "fever subsides and no pain may occur when the abscess is pressed upon. Deep\n",
      "abscess may not fluctuate.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in converting the abscess into an open wound\n",
      "whenever possible. The incision should extend to the lowest part of the\n",
      "wall, so as to insure complete drainage. A cold abscess in the shoulder\n",
      "region may become lined by a layer of tissue that retards healing. In order\n",
      "to hasten the healing process, it may be necessary to remove this. Until\n",
      "granulation is well advanced, the abscess cavity should be irrigated daily\n",
      "with a one per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compositus, or a one\n",
      "to two thousand water solution of corrosive sublimate. The surface of the\n",
      "skin in the region of the abscess should be kept clean.\n",

      "FISTULOUS WITHERS AND POLL EVIL.--These terms are applied to swellings,\n",
      "blood tumors, abscesses and pus fistulae that may be present in the region\n",
      "of the poll and withers (Fig. 60). Pus fistula is the characteristic lesion\n",
      "present, and it is the result of a suppurative inflammation of the tissues\n",
      "in the region. The abscess cavity or cavities are usually deep, and may\n",
      "involve the ligaments and vertebrae.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruises or contusions are the most _common causes_. The prominence of these\n",
      "regions predisposes them to injury in the stable, or when rolling on rough\n",
      "or stony ground. Bites and bruises to the withers resulting from other\n",
      "horses taking hold of the region with the teeth, or striking the part\n",
      "against a hard surface, are frequent causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and surgical. All possible causes should\n",
      "be investigated. This is of special importance on premises where several\n",
      "horses develop fistulous withers and poll evil. If the cause then becomes\n",
      "known, it should be removed.\n",

      "_The surgical treatment_ consists in opening up the different abscess\n",

      "that lines the walls of the cavities. Horses that are prone to rub the\n",
      "region should be prevented from doing this, as such irritation retards\n",
      "healing. Autogenous bacterins should be used in addition to the surgical\n",
      "treatment. A pus fistula should heal from the bottom, and if the opening\n",
      "becomes closed, drainage should be re-established. The daily treatment is\n",
      "the same as recommended for abscesses. Excessive cutting and destruction of\n",
      "the tissues with caustic preparations result in scarring and deformity of\n",

      "FRACTURES AND HARNESS INJURIES\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FRACTURES.--Broken bones or fractures are not uncommon in domestic animals.\n",
      "In the horse, the bones of the leg, forearm, foot, and spine are the most\n",
      "commonly broken. In the dog the largest percentage of fractures occurs in\n",
      "the superior regions of the limbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fractures may be classified as _simple_ and _compound, complete_ and\n",
      "_incomplete, comminuted_ or _splinter_. In the simple fracture the skin\n",
      "over the region escapes injury, but in the compound fracture the skin is\n",
      "broken and the ends of the broken bone may protrude through it. The terms\n",
      "complete and incomplete are used in describing fractures in which the ends\n",
      "of the bones are not attached to each other, or partially so. In the\n",
      "comminuted fracture the bone is broken into a number of pieces. There are a\n",
      "number of other terms that may be used in designating the different kinds\n",
      "of fractures, such as double, when both bones in the region are broken, and\n",
      "oblique, transverse and longitudinal, depending on the direction of the\n",
      "break.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The causes_ of fractures may be divided into external or mechanical, and\n",
      "internal. Fractures may result from kicks, blows, muscular strain and\n",
      "contusions. Abnormal fragility due to disease, extreme youth and old age\n",
      "are the internal predisposing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are crepitation, abnormal movement and deformity of the\n",
      "part. Abnormal movement of the part and inability to support weight occur\n",
      "in fractures of the bones of the limbs. Crepitation or a grinding, rubbing\n",
      "sound due to the movement of the ends of the broken bones on one another\n",
      "occurs when the part is moved or manipulated with the hands. Pain, swelling\n",
      "and injury to the skin are other local symptoms. The new tissue or bone\n",
      "callus is formed by the bone-forming cells in the deeper layer of the\n",
      "periosteum and bone-marrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The prognosis is unfavorable._ The larger percentage of fractures in\n",
      "domestic animals are incurable, or make an unsatisfactory recovery. This is\n",
      "due to careless treatment, the character of the fracture and the inability\n",
      "to fix the ends of the broken bone. Fractures in young and small animals\n",
      "usually heal quickly. Individuals that are healthy and vigorous usually\n",
      "make a speedy recovery. Fractures heal very slowly in the aged. Compound\n",
      "and comminuted fractures are impossible to treat in the larger percentage\n",
      "of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ consists in fixing the broken bone or bones in a normal\n",
      "position by means of bandages and splints. If this is not practised, the\n",
      "surrounding tissues become injured by the broken ends of the bone, and the\n",
      "fracture may become so complicated as to render treatment useless. Motion\n",
      "retards or prevents the repair of the break.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, fractures of the ribs, pelvic bones and sometimes long bones that\n",
      "are well covered by heavy muscles heal naturally or in the absence of any\n",
      "means of retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Bandaging_.--The attendant must use good judgment in devising means of\n",
      "fixing the broken bone, and in holding it in its natural position. Whenever\n",
      "possible, a plaster bandage should be used. This must not be made too\n",
      "heavy, and it is very necessary to adjust it properly, so that it will stay\n",
      "in place and not become too tight or too loose. When applied to the limb,\n",
      "the bandage should extend as far down as the hoof, and some distance above\n",
      "the break. This is necessary in order to keep it from slipping down and\n",
      "becoming too loose. A soft bandage should be applied first in order to\n",
      "equalize the pressure from the plaster cast and protect the skin. Wooden\n",
      "splints are not very satisfactory agents for the treatment of fractures.\n",
      "Thick leather that has been made soft by soaking in warm water and then\n",
      "shaping it to the part makes a more satisfactory splint. In all cases a\n",
      "soft bandage should be applied under the splint. The adjustment of the\n",
      "plaster bandage or splint should be noticed daily, and whenever necessary\n",
      "it should be removed and readjusted. Injuries to the skin must be carefully\n",
      "cleaned, disinfected and bandaged before applying the plaster bandage. If\n",
      "evidence of wound infection occurs later, the bandage must be removed and\n",
      "the wound treated. Large animals suffering with a fracture of any of the\n",
      "bones of the limb should be placed in slings. Incomplete fracture should\n",
      "receive the same treatment as simple fracture. If this is practised, the\n",
      "danger of its becoming complete is avoided.\n",

      "HARNESS INJURIES.--This class of injuries is common in horses that are\n",
      "given steady, hard work, or that are not accustomed to work. Young horses,\n",
      "when first put to hard work, are especially prone to injuries from the\n",
      "collar. A large proportion of these injuries are due to an ill-fitting\n",
      "harness or saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the harness is not adjusted or fitted properly, there is severe\n",
      "pressure on certain parts. This is the common cause of shoulder abscesses\n",
      "(Fig. 61), sore necks and sit-fasts. Rough, uneven surfaces on the faces of\n",
      "the collar and saddle are the common causes of galling. The character of\n",
      "the work is an important factor. Work that requires the animal to support\n",
      "weight on the top surface of the neck is productive of sore neck. Heavy\n",
      "work over rough, uneven ground frequently causes shoulder abscesses and\n",
      "strained muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest and most common harness injuries are galling, sore shoulders\n",
      "and sore neck. Harness galls first appear as flat, painful swellings. On\n",
      "raising the collar from the skin the inflamed area appears dry and the\n",
      "surrounding hair is wet with sweat. Later, the skin becomes hard and its\n",
      "outer layer, and sometimes the deeper layer as well, slough, or is rubbed\n",
      "off by friction of the harness. The surface then appears red and moist.\n",
      "Fluctuating swellings due to small collections of blood and lymph sometimes\n",
      "form. Sometimes, small areas on the face of the shoulder and that portion\n",
      "of the back pressed on by the saddle become swollen, indurated and hard and\n",
      "give the shoulder a rough appearance. Continuous irritation from the collar\n",
      "may cause an inflammatory thickening of the subcutaneous tissue in the\n",
      "shoulder region, and the skin appears loose and somewhat folded. This\n",
      "uneven surface is productive of chronic collar galls.\n",
      "\n",
      "_A sit-fast_ is characterized by a large swelling at the top of the neck,\n",
      "followed by a deep sloughing of the tissues. A slightly swollen, wrinkled\n",
      "condition of the skin over the top of the neck is sometimes present in\n",
      "horses that resist the attendant, when he attempts to handle the part or\n",
      "harness the animal. This form of sore neck is evidently very painful,\n",
      "although little evidence of inflammation is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strain of shoulder muscles and shoulder abscesses have been discussed under\n",
      "their separate heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment is very largely preventive_. Too little attention is given\n",
      "to the proper fitting of the harness and saddle. A well-fitted collar that\n",
      "properly distributes the weight on the shoulder, and is neither too small\n",
      "or too large at the top of the neck, is the best preventive for shoulder\n",
      "and neck injuries. Old, ill-fitting, lumpy collars should not be used.\n",
      "Neither should the same collar be used for different horses. Farmers should\n",
      "avoid using sweat pads that are lumpy or soaked with sweat. If soft and\n",
      "dry, such pads are useful in preventing galling. The surfaces of the collar\n",
      "or saddle that come in contact with the skin should be kept smooth and\n",
      "clean. In the spring of the year, it is advisable to bathe the shoulders of\n",
      "work horses with cold water twice a day. Bathing the shoulders with the\n",
      "following preparation is a useful preventive measure: lead acetate four\n",
      "ounces, zinc sulfate three ounces and water one gallon. Smooth leather pads\n",
      "for the top of the collar and saddle are useful preventive and curative\n",
      "agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Galls are lest treated by rest_. Ointments or \"gall cures\" are usually\n",
      "applied. The following dry dressing dusted over the red, moist, abraded\n",
      "surfaces is quite healing: tannic acid one ounce, boric acid four ounces,\n",
      "and calomel two ounces. This may be dusted over the part two or three times\n",
      "daily. Dry, abraded surfaces may be treated by applying a mixture of\n",
      "glycerine four ounces, tannic acid one-half ounce and carbolic acid one\n",
      "dram. In operating for the removal of fibrous enlargements, thickened skin\n",
      "and abscesses on the front of the shoulder, it is advisable to make the\n",
      "incision in the skin well to the side of the face of the shoulder in order\n",
      "to avoid scarring the surface that comes in contact with the collar.\n",

      "\n",
      "COMMON SURGICAL OPERATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DEHORNING CATTLE.--It is very often necessary to remove the horns of cattle\n",
      "in order to prevent their injuring or worrying certain individuals in the\n",
      "herd. This operation is of greatest economic importance in dairy and\n",
      "feeding cattle. When first practised, the dehorning of mature cattle was\n",
      "condemned by some persons who deemed it an inhuman and unnecessary\n",
      "operation. It is surely a humane act to remove the horns of cattle that are\n",
      "confined in small yards and pastures, and prevent them from painfully, or\n",
      "seriously, injuring one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most localities there are men who are well equipped to dehorn cattle,\n",
      "and able to perform this operation for a very moderate fee. It is not\n",
      "advisable to attempt to dehorn a number of adult cattle if the operator is\n",
      "not well equipped for the work. Unless a well-constructed dehorning rack is\n",
      "available for confining the animals, there is danger of injuring them and\n",
      "it is very difficult to saw off the horn quickly and satisfactorily. This\n",
      "increases the pain that the animal suffers, and horn stubs soon develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good equipment, such as a chute, saw or clippers, is necessary. A dehorning\n",
      "chute should be built of plank with a good frame well bolted together, with\n",
      "stanchion and nose block for confining the head. Most operators prefer a\n",
      "meat saw for cutting off the horns. It is preferable to dehorning shears,\n",
      "as there is danger of fracturing the frontal bone when removing the horns\n",
      "of mature cattle. The best form of dehorning shears have a wide V in the\n",
      "cutting edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The operation is very simple_. The horn should be cut off at a point from\n",
      "one-quarter to one-half an inch below the hair line or skin. If this is not\n",
      "practised, an irregular horn growth or stub of horn develops. It is usually\n",
      "unnecessary to apply anything to the wound. If the animal does not strike\n",
      "or rub the part, the clot that forms closes the blood-vessels and the\n",
      "haemorrhage stops. In case of haemorrhage of a serious nature, a small\n",
      "piece of absorbent cotton may be spread over the surface of the wound, and\n",
      "pushed in to the opening in order to keep it in place. Pine tar may be\n",
      "smeared over this dressing. Some operators prefer cauterizing the wound\n",
      "with a red-hot iron for the purpose of preventing haemorrhage. During warm\n",
      "weather, the wound should be washed daily with a two per cent water\n",
      "solution of a coal tar disinfectant, until healing is well advanced. A very\n",
      "necessary after-treatment is the washing of the part after two or three\n",
      "days for the purpose of removing the dried blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening at the base of the horn communicates directly with the frontal\n",
      "sinus, a large cavity situated between the two plates of the frontal bone.\n",
      "Sometimes the bone is slivered, or the wound becomes infected and inflamed.\n",
      "This may be due to a dirty dehorning saw, or getting dirt into the wound.\n",
      "The inflammation may extend to the sinus and a heavy discharge from the\n",
      "cavity occur. This complication may be prevented by placing the saw or\n",
      "cutters in a disinfectant when not in use, and cleaning and disinfecting\n",
      "the wound very carefully for a few days after the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The horn buttons of calves_ from a few days to one week of age can be\n",
      "destroyed, and the growth of the horn prevented by applying caustic soda or\n",
      "potash to them. The method of procedure is as follows: Clip away the hair\n",
      "from around the base of the horn tissue and apply a little vaseline to the\n",
      "skin near, but not close to, the base of the horn; moisten the horn button\n",
      "and rub it two or three times with the end of the stick of caustic; do not\n",
      "allow the calf to go out in the rain for a few days after applying the\n",
      "caustic. The horns of calves a few weeks of age may be removed with a sharp\n",
      "knife or calf dehorner.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHOKING.--This is a common accident in cattle and horses. The object that\n",
      "causes the choke may be lodged in the pharynx or oesophagus. Certain\n",
      "individuals are more prone to choke while feeding than others. This is\n",
      "because of their habit of eating greedily, and swallowing hastily without\n",
      "properly mixing the bolus with the saliva. For this reason, choking occurs\n",
      "when the animal is eating dry feed. Cattle frequently become choked on\n",
      "pieces of such food as roots and apples that are too large to readily pass\n",
      "down the oesophagus. Sharp objects taken in with the food sometimes become\n",
      "lodged in the oesophagus or pharynx.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ differ in complete and partial choke. In the latter, the\n",
      "symptoms are not very characteristic. The animal may stop feeding, but\n",
      "shows very little evidence of suffering pain. It may be able to swallow a\n",
      "little water. On attempting to drink, a part of the water may be returned\n",
      "through the nose, the same as in complete choke. Ineffectual efforts to\n",
      "swallow, salivation, coughing, hurried respiration, and an anxious\n",
      "expression of the face occur in complete choke. Bloating may complicate\n",
      "this accident in ruminants. After partial choke has persisted for a day or\n",
      "two, the animal appears dejected or distressed. Pressure on the trachea by\n",
      "hard objects may cause difficult respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mechanical pneumonia sometimes occurs. This is due to the food and water\n",
      "that the animal may attempt to swallow, being returned to the pharynx and\n",
      "passed into the air passages and lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is as follows: Animals that have choked should not be given\n",
      "access to feed of any kind. Any attempt to take food or drink water may\n",
      "result in pneumonia. It may be necessary to drench the animal with a very\n",
      "small quantity of water for the purpose of diagnosis. The most common form\n",
      "of choke in horses is that due to accumulation of dry food in the\n",
      "oesophagus. The administration of a drug that stimulates the secretion of\n",
      "saliva is a very successful method of relieving this form of choke.\n",
      "Pilocarpine is the drug commonly used. Cheap whips should not be introduced\n",
      "into the oesophagus for the purpose of dislodging the foreign body. There\n",
      "is always danger of the whip becoming broken off, and the broken part\n",
      "lodging in the oesophagus. Neither should such rigid objects as a broom or\n",
      "rake handle be introduced, because of the danger from serious injury to the\n",
      "walls of the pharynx and oesophagus. The flexible probang, which is usually\n",
      "made of spiral wire covered with leather, is a very useful instrument to\n",
      "relieve choke when in the hands of an experienced operator. If the object\n",
      "causing the choke is situated in the neck portion of the oesophagus, it may\n",
      "sometimes be moved forward, or toward the stomach by pressure with the\n",
      "fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "CASTRATION.--The castration of the male is a common operation in domestic\n",
      "animals. The purpose of the operation is to render the animal more useful\n",
      "for work or meat production.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The age_ at which the operation is performed varies in the different\n",
      "species. The colt is usually castrated when he is one year old, and the\n",
      "calf, pig and lamb when a few weeks or a few months of age. It is not\n",
      "advisable to castrate the young at weaning time. The operation and the\n",
      "weaning together may temporarily check the growth of the animal. Colts that\n",
      "are undeveloped and in poor flesh, or affected with colt distemper, should\n",
      "be allowed to recover before they are operated on. In all animals, it is\n",
      "advisable to wait until after they have recovered from disease and become\n",
      "thrifty and strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spring, early summer and fall are the most suitable seasons for\n",
      "castrating the young. It may be practised during the hot or cold months of\n",
      "the year with little danger from wound infection or other complications,\n",
      "providing the necessary after-attention can be given.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preparation of the animal_ for the operation by withholding all feed\n",
      "for about twelve hours is very advisable. If this is practised, the stomach\n",
      "and intestines are not distended with feed, and the young are cleaner,\n",
      "easier to handle and suffer less from castration. Clean quarters and\n",
      "surroundings are very necessary to the success of the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The instruments required_ are sharp knives, preferably a heavy scalpel and\n",
      "a probe-pointed bistoury, an emasculator for large and mature animals, and\n",
      "surgeon's needles and suture material. Ropes and casting harness are\n",
      "frequently used for confining and casting the large and mature animals. Two\n",
      "clean pans or pails filled with a two per cent water solution of liquor\n",
      "cresolis compositus, or an equally reliable disinfectant, should be\n",
      "provided for cleaning the scrotum and neighboring parts and the\n",
      "instruments. Pieces of absorbent cotton or oakum may be used in washing and\n",
      "cleaning the scrotum. The instruments should be sterilized in boiling water\n",
      "before using.\n",
      "\n",
      "_If a number of pigs or lambs_ are to be castrated, it is best to confine\n",
      "them in a small, clean, well-bedded pen. This enables the attendant to\n",
      "catch them quickly and without unnecessary excitement or exercise. They\n",
      "should be taken to an adjoining pen to be castrated. The scrotum should be\n",
      "washed with the disinfectant, and the testicles pressed tightly against the\n",
      "scrotal wall. An incision parallel with the middle line or raphe and a\n",
      "little to one side is made through the skin and the coverings of the\n",
      "testicle, and the testicle pressed out through the incision. The testicle\n",
      "and cords are then pulled well out and the cord broken off with a quick\n",
      "jerk and twist, or scraped off with a knife. The latter method is to be\n",
      "preferred in large lambs if the operator does not have an emasculator. The\n",
      "incision in the scrotum should be extended from its base to the lowest\n",
      "part, in order to secure perfect drainage.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Young calves_ may be castrated in the standing position or when cast and\n",
      "held on the side. The method of operating is the same as recommended for\n",
      "pigs and lambs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The castration of the colt_ may be performed in either the standing\n",
      "position or when cast. The method of operating is the same as practised in\n",
      "the smaller animals with the exception of cutting off the cord. The\n",
      "emasculator is used here. This instrument crushes the stump of the cord and\n",
      "prevents haemorrhage from the cut ends of the blood-vessels. Careful\n",
      "aseptic precautions must be observed in operating on colts, as they are\n",
      "very susceptible to wound infection and peritonitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blood-vessels of the testicular cord are larger in the adult animals,\n",
      "and the danger from haemorrhage is greater than in the young. For this\n",
      "reason, it is advisable to use an emasculator in castrating all mature\n",
      "animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complications Following Castration.--The _haemorrhage_ from the wound and\n",
      "stump of cord is usually unimportant in the young animals. Serious\n",
      "haemorrhage from the vessels of the cord sometimes occur in the adult, and\n",
      "a persistent haemorrhage results when a subcutaneous vein is cut in making\n",
      "the incision in the scrotum. This complication is not usually serious, and\n",
      "can be prevented and controlled by observing proper precautions in cutting\n",
      "off the cord, or by picking up the cut ends of the vessel and ligating it.\n",
      "Packing the scrotal sack with sterile gauze or absorbent cotton, and\n",
      "closing the incision with sutures may be practised for the purpose of\n",
      "stopping this form of haemorrhage. The packing should be removed in about\n",
      "twelve hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The infection of the wound_ always follows castration. If the incision is\n",
      "small and the operation is followed by swelling of the neighboring tissues,\n",
      "the clotted blood, wound secretions and pus become penned up in the scrotal\n",
      "sack. Local blood poisoning or peritonitis follows. This is not an uncommon\n",
      "complication. It can be prevented by aseptic precautions in operating, and\n",
      "insuring good drainage by extending the incision to the lowest part of the\n",
      "scrotal sac. The scrotal sac always contracts down and becomes more or less\n",
      "swollen within a day or two following castration. We must keep this in mind\n",
      "when enlarging the opening, and be sure and make it plenty large to permit\n",
      "the escape of the infectious matter. In castrating sheep, all wool in the\n",
      "region of the scrotal sac should be clipped off, as this interferes with\n",
      "drainage from the wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Exercise following castration_ is almost as essential as clean quarters.\n",
      "Lack of exercise leads to _oedematous swelling_ in the region of the\n",
      "scrotum, and the lips of the incision may become adhered if the animal is\n",
      "at rest. Colts and all mature animals that are confined in close quarters\n",
      "should be examined within forty-eight hours following the operation, and\n",
      "the condition of the wound noted. If closed, the hands should be cleaned\n",
      "and disinfected, and the adhesion broken down with the fingers. It is best\n",
      "to exercise horses daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unsafe to expose castrated animals to cold, damp, chilly weather. The\n",
      "shock and soreness resulting from the operation render the animal highly\n",
      "susceptible to pleurisy and pneumonia. This is especially true of young\n",
      "colts.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Inguinal hernia_ or \"_rupture_\" may complicate the operation. This form of\n",
      "hernia is quite frequently met with in pigs, and only occasionally in the\n",
      "other animals. This complication is usually overcome by practising what is\n",
      "commonly termed the covered operation. The pig is usually held or hung up\n",
      "by the hind legs. A larger animal is placed on its back. The hernia is\n",
      "reduced by manipulating the mass of intestines with the fingers, so that\n",
      "they drop back into the abdominal cavity. The part is carefully cleaned and\n",
      "disinfected and an incision made through the scrotal wall, and the thin\n",
      "covering or serous sac in which the testicle is lodged is exposed. The\n",
      "testicle with the cord and covering is drawn well out of the scrotum and\n",
      "held by an attendant. The operator then passes a needle carrying a strong\n",
      "silk thread through the cord and covering, below the point where he intends\n",
      "severing it. The needle is removed and the cord and covering ligated at\n",
      "this point. The cord is then cut off about one-half an inch from the\n",
      "ligature, and the incision in the scrotum made plenty large in order to\n",
      "insure drainage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very essential to the success of this operation that the animal be\n",
      "dieted for twelve or eighteen hours before attempting to operate. The\n",
      "after-treatment consists in giving the animal separate quarters and feeding\n",
      "a light diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Enlarged or scirrhous cords_ follow infection of the wound, usually with\n",
      "spores of a certain fungus (_Botryomyces_). This complication more often\n",
      "follows castration of cattle and pigs than of colts. Wrong methods of\n",
      "operating, such as leaving the stump of the cord too long and insufficient\n",
      "drainage for the pus and wound secretions, are the factors that favor this\n",
      "complication. Scirrhous cords or fibrous tumors should be dissected out and\n",
      "removed before they have become large and begun breaking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "CASTRATION OF RIDGELING OR CRYPTORCHID ANIMALS.--In the ridgeling animal\n",
      "one or both of the testicles have not descended into the scrotal sac, and\n",
      "are usually lodged in the inguinal canal or abdominal cavity. If the\n",
      "testicle is lodged in the inguinal canal the animal is termed a \"flanker.\"\n",
      "In yearling colts the testicular cord is sometimes short, and the testicle\n",
      "is situated high up in the scrotum and inguinal canal. In examining a\n",
      "supposed cryptorchid colt, he should be twitched. This may cause the\n",
      "testicle to descend into the scrotum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The castration of a true cryptorchid requires a special operation. When\n",
      "properly performed and the animal given special after-care, the operation\n",
      "is not followed by any serious complications. An abnormally large, diseased\n",
      "testicle is sometimes met with that cannot be removed in the usual way, and\n",
      "which complicates and increases the difficulty of operating.\n",
      "\n",
      "CAPONIZING.--The castration or caponizing of the male chicken is commonly\n",
      "practised in certain localities. This operation changes the disposition of\n",
      "the cockerel. He becomes more quiet and sluggish, never crows, the head is\n",
      "small, the comb and wattles cease growing and the hackle and saddle\n",
      "feathers become well developed. A capon always develops more uniformly and\n",
      "is larger than the cockerel.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The best time to caponize the cockerel_ is when he weighs between two or\n",
      "three pounds. If older and heavier, the testicle becomes so large that it\n",
      "is very difficult to remove, and the danger from tearing the spermatic\n",
      "artery and a fatal haemorrhage resulting is greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several kinds of _caponizing instruments_. They may be purchased\n",
      "in sets. Each set should contain an instrument for removing the testicle; a\n",
      "knife for making the incision through the abdominal wall; a sharp hook for\n",
      "tearing through the thin membrane; spring spreader for holding the lips of\n",
      "the incision apart; a blunt probe for keeping the intestines out of the way\n",
      "of the operator; and a pair of tweezers for removing clots of blood. The\n",
      "different instruments for removing the testicles are a spoon-like scoop,\n",

      "_The cockerel_ is confined for the operation by passing a strong noose of\n",
      "cord around both legs, and a second noose around the wings close to the\n",
      "body, that have weights fastened to them. The cords pass through holes or\n",
      "loops in a barrel or board that is used for an operating table. This holds\n",
      "the cockerel firmly and prevents his struggling.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The bird should be prepared_ for the operation by withholding all feed and\n",
      "water for a period of twenty-four hours or longer, for the purpose of\n",
      "emptying out the intestine. The operator must have a strong light, in order\n",
      "to work quickly and safely. Direct sunlight or electric light should be\n",
      "used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instruments should be placed in a two per cent water solution of\n",
      "carbolic acid. A second vessel containing a two per cent water solution of\n",
      "liquor cresolis compound for cleaning the skin is necessary. Absorbent\n",
      "cotton should be used for washing the wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The general method of operating_ is as follows: The incision is made\n",
      "between the last two ribs and in front of the thigh. The feathers over this\n",
      "region should be removed, and the skin pulled to one side before making the\n",
      "incision. An incision about one and one-half inches in length is made\n",
      "through the skin and muscles, and the spreader inserted. The sharp hook is\n",
      "then inserted and the thin serous membrane over the intestine is torn\n",
      "through. The testicles are situated in the superior portion of the\n",
      "abdominal cavity or under the back. On pushing the intestines to one side,\n",
      "both testicles, which are about the size of a bean and yellowish in color,\n",
      "can be seen. The lower one should be removed first. After removing both\n",
      "testicles, blood clots, feathers, or any foreign body that may have gotten\n",
      "into the wound should be picked up with the tweezers before removing the\n",
      "spreaders and allowing the wound to close. No special after-treatment is\n",
      "required.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The most common complication_ is rupture of the spermatic artery. This\n",
      "occurs at the time the testicle is torn loose and may be due to careless\n",
      "methods, or operating on cockerels that are too large. If all of the\n",
      "testicle is not removed from the abdominal cavity, the bird is termed a\n",
      "\"slip.\" Sometimes air puffs form after the operation. These should be\n",
      "punctured with a sharp knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "OVARIOTOMY, \"SPAYING.\"--The removal of the ovaries, or ovariotomy, is\n",
      "practised for the purpose of rendering the female more useful for meat\n",
      "production, prolonging the period of lactation, overcoming vicious habits\n",
      "and preventing oestrum or heat. The operation is commonly performed in the\n",
      "heifer and bitch, occasionally in the mare, and at present rarely in the\n",
      "sow.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Heifers_ are usually spayed between the ages of eight and twelve months;\n",
      "the _bitch_ and _sow_ when a few months old, or before the periods of heat\n",
      "have begun. The _mare_ is spayed when mature. It is possible to spay the\n",
      "female at any age, but the ages mentioned are the most convenient. Pregnant\n",
      "animals should not be operated on. The season of the year makes little\n",
      "difference in the results, providing the animal can be kept under close\n",
      "observation and given the necessary care and treatment. The spring of the\n",
      "year, just before turning the herd on pasture, is the best season to spay\n",
      "heifers.\n",
      "\n",
      "_All animals should be prepared_ for the operation by withholding all feed\n",
      "for at least twenty-four hours before they are operated on, and it may be\n",
      "advisable to give them a physic. It is easier to operate when the\n",
      "intestinal tract is comparatively empty, and the death rate is lower than\n",
      "when the animal is not properly prepared for the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The method of operating_ is not the same in the different species. In\n",
      "young heifers and sows, the flank operation is preferred, and in mares and\n",
      "cows, the vaginal operation. The median line operation is practised in\n",

      "\n",
      "The animal must be properly confined for the operation. Heifers are usually\n",
      "held in the standing position by fastening the head securely, and crowding\n",
      "the left side of the animal against a solid board partition, or side of a\n",
      "chute. If the vaginal operation is performed, the mare or cow may be\n",
      "confined in stocks. The bitch is usually anesthetized and placed on her\n",

      "PARASITIC INSECTS AND MITES\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Parasitic insects are common causes of skin diseases in domestic animals.\n",
      "The diseased conditions of the skin, and the irritation that they may cause\n",
      "the animal, depend on the life history and habits of the parasite. Species\n",
      "that are unable to live independently of a host and are permanent parasites\n",
      "are usually the most injurious to the animal. This is especially true of\n",
      "parasites that are capable of puncturing the skin or burrowing into it.\n",
      "Temporary parasites may cause fatal forms of disease. This is true of the\n",
      "larva? of the sheep bot-fly, which develop in the sinuses of the head,\n",
      "causing severe inflammation of these parts, nervous symptoms and death. The\n",
      "character of the symptoms of a parasitic disease depends on the habits of\n",
      "the parasite, and the tissue or organ, that it may attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parasitic flies belong to the order _Diptera_, and the families\n",
      "_Muscidae_ and _OEstridae_. Fleas belong to the sub-order _Pulicidae_. The\n",
      "order _Hemiptera_ includes the lice, and the most important families are\n",
      "_Pediculidae_ and _Ricinidae_. Mites and ticks belong to the order\n",
      "_Acarina_. The most important parasites belonging to this order are the\n",
      "_Sarcoptidae_ and _Ixodidae_.\n",
      "\n",
      "OESTRIDAE.--The three common bot-flies are the _Gastrophilus equi_,\n",
      "_Hypoderma lineata_ and _OEstrus ovis_. These flies are important because\n",
      "of the parasitic habits of their larva. They inhabit the stomach and\n",
      "intestines of horses (Fig. 62); the subcutaneous tissue and skin of cattle;\n",
      "and the sinuses of the head and nasal cavities of sheep.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The common bot-fly of the horse_ (_G. equi_) has a heavy, hairy body. Its\n",
      "color is brown, with dark and yellowish spots. The female fly can be seen\n",
      "during the warm weather, hovering around the horse, and darting toward the\n",
      "animal for the purpose of depositing the egg. The color of the egg is\n",
      "yellow, and it adheres firmly to the hair. It hatches in from two to four\n",
      "weeks, and the larva reaches the mouth through the animal licking the part.\n",
      "From the mouth, it passes to the stomach, where it attaches itself to the\n",
      "gastric mucous membrane (Fig. 62). Here it remains until fully developed,\n",
      "when it becomes detached and is passed out with the fasces. The third stage\n",
      "is passed in the ground. This takes place in the spring and early summer\n",
      "and lasts for several weeks, when it finally emerges a mature fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 62.--A piece of the wall of the horse's stomach showing\n",
      "the bot-fly larvae attached.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The bot-fly of the ox_ (_H. lineata_) is dark in color and about the size\n",
      "of a honey-bee. On warm days, the female may be seen depositing eggs on the\n",
      "body of the animal, especially in the region of the heels. This seems to\n",
      "greatly annoy the animal, and it is not uncommon for cattle to become\n",
      "stampeded. The egg reaches the mouth through the animal licking the part.\n",
      "The saliva dissolves the shell of the egg and the larva is freed. It then\n",
      "migrates from the gullet, wanders about in the tissue until finally it may\n",
      "reach a point beneath the skin of the back. Here the larva matures and\n",
      "forms the well-known swelling or warble. In the spring of the year it works\n",
      "out through the skin. The next stage is spent in the ground. The pupa state\n",
      "lasts several weeks, when the mature fly issues forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The bot-fly of sheep_ (_O. ovis_) resembles an overgrown house-fly. Its\n",
      "general color is brown, and it is apparently lazy, flying about very\n",
      "little. This bot-fly makes its appearance when the warm weather begins, and\n",
      "deposits live larvae in the nostrils of sheep. This act is greatly feared\n",
      "by the animals, as shown by their crowding together and holding the head\n",
      "down. The larva works up the nasal cavities and reaches the sinuses of the\n",
      "head, where it becomes attached to the lining mucous membrane. In the\n",
      "spring, when fully developed, it passes out through the nasal cavities and\n",
      "nostrils, drops to the ground, buries itself, and in from four to six weeks\n",
      "develops into the mature fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "SYMPTOMS OF BOT-FLY DISEASES.--The larvae of the bot-fly of the horse do\n",
      "not cause characteristic symptoms of disease. Work horses that are groomed\n",
      "daily are not hosts for a large number of \"bots,\" but young and old horses\n",
      "that are kept in a pasture or lot and seldom groomed may become unthrifty\n",
      "and \"pot bellied,\" or show symptoms of indigestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cattle suffer much pain from the development of the larva of the _H.\n",
      "lineata_. During the spring of the year, the pain resulting from the\n",
      "presence of the larvae beneath the skin and the penetration of the skin is\n",
      "manifested by excitement and running about. Besides the loss in milk and\n",
      "beef production, there is a heavy yearly loss from the damage to hides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parasitic life of the bot-fly of sheep results in a severe catarrhal\n",
      "inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the sinuses of the head, and a\n",
      "discharge of a heavy, pus-like material from the nostrils. The irritation\n",
      "produced by the larvae may be so serious at times as to result in nervous\n",
      "symptoms and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "TREATMENT OF BOT-FLY DISEASES.--The treatment of the different bot-fly\n",
      "diseases is largely preventive. This consists in either the destruction of\n",
      "the eggs or the larvae.\n",
      "\n",
      "The different methods of destroying the eggs of the bot-fly of the horse\n",
      "are clipping the hair from the part, scraping off the eggs with a sharp\n",
      "knife, or destroying them by washing the part infested with eggs with a two\n",
      "or three per cent water solution of carbolic acid. This should be practised\n",
      "every two weeks during the period when the female deposits the eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing the cattle, or applying water solutions of certain preparations to\n",
      "the skin that may keep the female from depositing eggs, may be practised\n",
      "for the prevention of the ox-warble. The most practical method of ridding\n",
      "cattle of this pest is to destroy the larvae. This can be done by examining\n",
      "each animal and locating the swelling or warble and injecting a few drops\n",
      "of kerosene into the opening in the skin. A better method is to enlarge the\n",
      "opening in the skin with a sharp knife, squeeze out the grub and destroy\n",
      "it. This should be practised in late winter and early spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application of pine tar to the nostrils of sheep is the most practical\n",
      "method of preventing \"grub in the head.\" This should be practised every few\n",
      "days during the summer months. A very good preventive measure is plenty of\n",
      "shade for the flock. Valuable animals may be treated by trephining into the\n",
      "head sinus and removing the \"grub.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LICE.--The sucking lice belong to the genus _Hoematopinus_, and the biting\n",
      "lice of mammals belong to the genus _Trichodectes_. Different species of\n",
      "sucking and biting lice occur on the different species of farm animals.\n",
      "Poultry act as hosts for many different species of biting lice belonging to\n",
      "the following genuses: _Lipiurus, Goniodes, Goniocotes_ and _Menopon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The common sucking lice_ occurring on animals are the large-headed horse\n",
      "louse, _H. macrocephalus_; the long-nosed ox louse, _H. tenuirostris_; the\n",
      "large-bellied ox louse, _H. curysternus_; the _H. stenopses_ of sheep; _H.\n",
      "suis_ of swine; and the _H. piliferus_ of the dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _common biting lice_ (Fig. 63) that are found on domestic animals are\n",
      "the _T. pilosus_ and _T. pubescens_ of solipeds, _T. scalaris_ of the ox,\n",
      "_T. spoerocephalus_ of sheep and goats, _T. latus_ and _T. subrostratus_ of\n",
      "the dog and cat. _Menopon palidum, Lipiurus variabilis_ and _Gonoides\n",
      "dissimilis_ are the common lice found on poultry.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Biting louse.]\n",
      "\n",
      "SYMPTOMS OF LICE.--The symptoms of lousiness depend on the variety of lice\n",
      "present, the degree to which the animal is infested with them, its physical\n",
      "condition and the care that it receives. Lice multiply more rapidly and\n",
      "cause greater loss during the winter months than they do in the summer,\n",
      "when the animals are not housed and the opportunity for infection from the\n",
      "surroundings is not so great. The sucking louse (Fig. 64) is the most\n",
      "injurious and irritating. The irritation and loss of blood that the animal\n",
      "may suffer when badly infested by this parasite may result in marked\n",
      "unthriftiness. Young and old animals that are not well cared for suffer\n",
      "most. The biting louse may bite through the superficial layer of the skin,\n",
      "and cause the animal to bite and rub the part. This irritation to the skin\n",
      "prevents the animal from becoming rested, and after a time seriously\n",
      "interferes with its thriftiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Horses and mules_ show a staring, dirty, rough coat. The mane and tail may\n",
      "become broken and matted. The animal rubs against the stall, fences and\n",
      "trees, and bites the skin in its efforts to relieve the irritation. On\n",
      "examining the coat, nits are found adhering to the hair (Fig. 65). We\n",
      "should examine the parts of the skin covered by the long hair for the\n",
      "sucking lice; and the withers, abdomen and limbs for the biting lice.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Sucking louse (much enlarged).]\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Nits attached to hair (much enlarged).]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms of lousiness in cattle_ are about the same as occur in\n",
      "horses. Licking and rubbing the skin are prominent symptoms in cattle, and\n",
      "the coat becomes dirty and rough. The licked part is matted and curled. The\n",
      "lice may be discovered by parting the hair along the back and rump.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The biting louse of sheep_ causes the fleece to become matted and tufts of\n",
      "wool are pulled out. This is brought about by the sheep rubbing and\n",
      "nibbling the fleece, and the lice cutting through the wool. The loss due to\n",
      "the damage to the fleece is usually greater than that resulting from\n",
      "unthriftiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The hog-louse_ is the largest specie known. As well as the largest, it is\n",
      "the most common of all lice found on domestic animals. The favorite points\n",
      "of attack are the under surface of the body, the neck and the inside of the\n",
      "thighs. The irritation and itching are severe, and the hog rubs and\n",
      "scratches the skin. Young hogs suffer most from this parasite, and their\n",
      "thriftiness is greatly interfered with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long-haired breeds of _dogs_ suffer more from lice than the\n",
      "short-haired breeds. The almost constant scratching and biting of the skin\n",
      "result in its becoming badly irritated and scabby. The symptoms differ\n",
      "little from irritation to the skin caused by fleas, but the presence of\n",
      "biting or sucking lice enables the person making the examination to\n",
      "determine the cause of the irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lice are the most common parasites of _poultry_. It is uncommon to meet\n",
      "with a flock of fowls that are not hosts for one or more of the many\n",
      "different varieties of bird lice. Restlessness, picking, scratching,\n",
      "flapping the wings, abandoning the nest and loss of condition are common\n",
      "symptoms. Young birds suffer most from lice. This is especially true of\n",
      "young chickens, death frequently resulting. Old fowls may show little\n",
      "inconvenience unless badly infested. The finding of the lice with the head\n",
      "imbedded in the skin or on the feathers enables the person making the\n",
      "examination to positively diagnose the case. The head, back, region of the\n",
      "vent and beneath the wings are the parts that should be carefully examined\n",
      "for lice.\n",
      "\n",
      "TREATMENT OF LOUSINESS.--The preventive treatment is very important. This\n",
      "consists in carefully examining all animals or birds that have been\n",
      "purchased recently, and if found to harbor lice, excluding them from the\n",
      "herd or flock until after they have been properly treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to rid animals of lice if the quarters are thoroughly\n",
      "cleaned and disinfected. This is necessary in order to destroy lice that\n",
      "have become scattered about by the lousy animals, and prevent the\n",
      "reinfection of the treated animals. The best method to use in cleaning the\n",
      "quarters is to remove all litter and manure from the stable or houses and\n",
      "their immediate surroundings. It should be burned, or hauled to a field or\n",
      "lot where other animals cannot come in contact with it for a few months.\n",
      "The walls, floors and partitions should be sprayed with a three per cent\n",
      "water solution of liquor cresolis compositus. Lime may be scattered about\n",
      "the buildings, yards and runs. The most satisfactory method of destroying\n",
      "lice on the bodies of animals is by washing or dipping in a water solution\n",
      "or mixture of some reliable disinfectant or oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Running hogs through a dipping tank_ that contains a one or two per cent\n",
      "water solution of liquor cresolis compositus, or a coal tar disinfectant,\n",
      "or that has from three-fourths to one and one-half inches of oil on top of\n",
      "the water, is the most satisfactory method of destroying the hog louse.\n",
      "Because of the thinness of the hog's coat and the danger from irritating\n",
      "the skin when strong solutions of a disinfectant are used, most swine\n",
      "breeders prefer crude oil as a remedy for lousiness in hogs. Crude oil may\n",
      "be applied to the bodies of hogs with a swab. If this method is practised\n",
      "instead of dipping, it is advisable to crowd the hogs into a small pen, and\n",
      "apply the oil in front and between the thighs and back of the arms. This\n",
      "may be practised during the cold weather when it is impossible to dip the\n",
      "animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Horses_ may be washed with a one or two per cent water solution of liquor\n",
      "cresolis compositus, or a coal tar disinfectant. If the weather is cold, it\n",
      "is advisable to pick a sunny day, and blanket the animal after rubbing it\n",
      "as dry as possible in order to prevent chilling and catching cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Cattle_ may be treated in the same manner as horses. Mercurial ointment\n",
      "rubbed in small amounts on the skin back of the horns and ears, where the\n",
      "animal cannot lick it, is a common remedy. The absorption of a small amount\n",
      "of this drug does the animal no harm, but a larger quantity may salivate\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sheep_ are treated by dipping in a water solution of a reliable coal tar\n",
      "disinfectant. This should not be practised during cold weather, as the\n",
      "fleece does not dry out. Insect powder may be dusted into the fleece when\n",
      "it is impossible to dip the animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very satisfactory treatment for lousiness in _dogs_ and _cats_ is to wash\n",
      "them with carbolized soap. We should wait a few minutes before rinsing off\n",
      "the soapy lather and drying the coat.\n",
      "\n",

      "The common parasitic diseases of domestic animals are caused by the\n",
      "following groups of worms: _Flukes_ or _trematoides_; _tapeworms_ or\n",
      "_Cestoides_; _thorn-headed worms_ or _Acanthocephales_; and _round-worms_\n",
      "or _Nematoids_. Flat worms, such as tapeworms and flukes, require secondary\n",
      "hosts. The immature and mature forms of tapeworms are parasites of\n",
      "vertebrate animals, but an invertebrate host is necessary for the\n",
      "completion of the life cycle of the fluke. The hog is the only specie of\n",
      "domestic animals that becomes a host for the thorn-headed worm. The\n",
      "round-worm is a very common parasite. There are many species belonging to\n",
      "this class.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Liver flukes.]\n",
      "\n",
      "DISTOMA HEPATICUM (COMMON LIVER FLUKE).--Sheep are the most common hosts\n",
      "for this parasite. It is present in the gall ducts and livers, and causes a\n",
      "disease of the liver known as liver rot. The liver fluke is flat or\n",
      "leaf-like and from thirteen to fifteen mm. long (Fig. 70). The head portion\n",
      "is conical. It has an oval and ventral sucker, and the body is covered with\n",
      "scaly spines. The eggs are oval and brownish in color.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The life history_, in brief, is as follows: Each adult is capable of\n",
      "producing an immense number of eggs which are carried down the bile ducts\n",
      "with the bile to the intestine, and are passed off with the faeces. Under\n",
      "favorable conditions for incubation, such as warm, moist surroundings, the\n",
      "ova or eggs hatch and the _ciliated embryos_ become freed. The embryo next\n",
      "penetrates into the body of certain snails and encysts. The _sporocyst_, as\n",
      "it is now called, develops into a third generation known as _redia_ which\n",
      "escape from the cyst. The _daughter redia_ or _cercaria_, as they are now\n",
      "termed, leave the body of the snail and finally become encysted on the\n",
      "stems of grass, cresses and weeds. When taken into the digestive tract of\n",
      "the animal grazing over infested ground, the immature flukes are freed by\n",
      "the digestive juices. They then pass from the intestine into the bile\n",
      "ducts. The period of development varies from ten to twenty weeks; each\n",
      "sporocyst may give rise to from five to eight _redia_ and each redia to\n",
      "from twelve to twenty _cercaria_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluke diseases occur among animals pastured on low, wet, undrained land.\n",
      "Drying ponds and lakes are the homes of the fresh water snails, and in such\n",
      "places there are plenty of hosts for the immature flukes. Wet seasons favor\n",
      "the development of this parasite. Cattle and sheep that pasture on river\n",
      "bottom land in certain sections of the southern portion of the United\n",
      "States are frequently affected with fluke diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms of liver rot of sheep_ may be divided into two stages. The\n",
      "first stage is marked by increase in weight and improved condition. In the\n",
      "second stage of the disease, the animal shows a pale skin and mucous\n",
      "membrane, dropsical swellings, loss of flesh and weakness. The character of\n",
      "the symptoms of the disease depends on the age of the animals and the care\n",
      "that they receive. Young, poorly cared for animals suffer severely from the\n",
      "disease, and the death rate is usually heavy. The finding of fluke ova in\n",
      "the faeces is conclusive evidence of the nature of the disease. It may be\n",
      "advisable to kill one of the sick animals, and determine the nature of the\n",
      "disease by a post-mortem examination.\n",

      "snails harboring immature flukes is a source of infection, and should not\n",
      "be used as a water supply for cattle and sheep. In sections where the\n",
      "disease is prevalent, sheep should not be pastured on low, poorly-drained\n",
      "land. Such land should be used for pasturing horses and cattle, but if\n",
      "possible, it should be first drained and cultivated. Careful feeding and\n",

      "TAPEWORMS OR CESTOIDES.--Tapeworms are formed by a chain of segments,\n",

      "head segment is small, and possesses either hooks or suckers. It is by\n",
      "these that the worm attaches itself to the lining membrane of the\n",
      "intestine. The anterior segments are smaller and less mature than the\n",
      "posterior segments. Each segment is sexually complete, possessing both the\n",
      "male and female organs, and when mature, one or more of them break off and\n",
      "are passed out with the faeces. The mature or ripe segments are filled with\n",
      "ova. On reaching the digestive tract of a proper host, usually with the\n",
      "drinking water or fodder, the embryo is freed from the egg. The _armed\n",
      "embryo_ uses its hooklets in boring its way through the wall of the\n",
      "intestine. It then wanders through the tissues of its host until it finally\n",
      "reaches a suitable place for development (Figs. 71 and 73). On coming to\n",

      "is a source of infection to the other fowls. The infectious nature of\n",
      "parasitic disease caused by worms should be recognized more fully than at\n",
      "present by poultrymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The different species of poultry are hosts for many different species of\n",
      "round-worms, thorn-headed worms and tapeworms. Dr. Kaupp states that\n",
      "_Acaris inflexa_ or large round-worm, _Heterakis pipilosa_ or small\n",
      "round-worm, and the _Spiroptera hamulosa_ or gizzard-worm are frequently\n",
      "found in fowls. The common round-worm may be found in the first portion of\n",
      "the intestine, and the small round-worm in the caecum. Neither of the\n",
      "species are dangerous unless present in large numbers. They may then\n",
      "obstruct the intestine, and irritate the intestinal mucous membrane. This\n",
      "may cause constipation, catarrhal inflammation of the intestine and\n",
      "diarrhoea. The gizzard-worm is the most dangerous of the parasites\n",
      "mentioned. The gizzard has an important digestive function, and any\n",
      "condition that may weaken its muscular walls may cause serious digestive\n",
      "disorders. This parasite may encyst in the wall of the gizzard.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ of intestinal worms in poultry is both preventive and\n",
      "curative. The preventive measures consist in keeping the houses and runs\n",
      "clean. Air-slaked lime should be scattered over the runs every few weeks.\n",
      "The drinking places should be cleaned and disinfected daily. All possible\n",
      "precautions should be taken in order to prevent filth from getting into the\n",
      "drinking water. Epsom salts, powdered areca nut and santonin are the\n",
      "remedies commonly recommended for the treatment of intestinal worms. From\n",
      "twenty to forty grains of Epsom salts may be given. Powdered areca nut is\n",
      "recommended in from three to ten grain doses. Santonin may be given in from\n",
      "one to two grain doses. Both the areca nut and santonin may be given with\n",
      "the feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE GAPES IN BIRDS.--The gape-worm, _Syngamus trachealis_, is from 0.2 to\n",
      "0.8 inch (5 to 20 mm.) long. The male and female are permanently united.\n",
      "The male is about one-third as long as the female, and when attached to the\n",
      "anterior third of the female, gives the pair a forked appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fowls become infested with the gape-worm by eating the adult parasite that\n",
      "has been expectorated, or an earth worm that is host for the immature\n",
      "parasite. The embryo gape-worm is freed in the intestine, and from here\n",
      "they are supposed to migrate into the abdominal air sacs and to the trachea\n",
      "and bronchi.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptom_ are most severe in very young fowls. The affected bird opens\n",
      "its mouth and appears to gasp for breath, sneeze and attempt to swallow. In\n",
      "the severe cases the appetite is interfered with, mucus accumulates in the\n",
      "mouth and the bird is dull and listless. The death rate is quite high in\n",
      "young-chickens and turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. If the gape-worm is known\n",
      "to be present in the runs, the ground should be covered with lime, and the\n",
      "fowls moved to fresh runs if possible. The young birds should not be\n",
      "exposed to the infection until they are well feathered out. Antiseptics may\n",
      "be given with the drinking water. Disinfectants should be used freely about\n",
      "the poultry houses, and the quarters kept clean. The worms may be snared by\n",
      "inserting a stiff horse hair that has been twisted and forms a loop into\n",
      "the trachea. This may be dipped into camphorated oil or turpentine. This\n",

      "HOG-CHOLERA\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "HOG-CHOLERA is a highly infectious disease of swine. It is characterized by\n",
      "an inflammation, of the lymphatic glands, kidneys, intestines, lungs and\n",
      "skin. The inflammation is hemorrhagic in character, the inflamed organs\n",
      "usually showing deep red spots or blotches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hog-cholera is especially prevalent in the corn-raising States which\n",
      "possess a denser hog population than any other section of the United\n",
      "States. In this country the loss from hog-cholera in 1913 amounted to more\n",
      "than $60,000,000, and it may be considered of greater economic importance\n",
      "than any of the other animal diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPECIFIC CAUSE.--The specific cause of hog-cholera is an _ultra-visible\n",
      "organism_ that is present in the excretions, secretions and tissues of a\n",
      "cholera hog. De Schweinitz and Dorset in 1903 produced typical hog-cholera\n",
      "by inoculating hogs with cholera-blood filtrates that were free from any\n",
      "organism that could be demonstrated by microscopical examination or any\n",
      "cultural method. The term ultra-visible virus is applied to the virus of\n",
      "hog-cholera.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The ultra-visible virus_ is eliminated from the body of the cholera hog\n",
      "with the body secretions and excretions. Healthy hogs contract the disease\n",
      "by eating feed or drinking water that is infected with the virus. There are\n",
      "other methods of infection, but field and experimental data show that\n",
      "hog-cholera is commonly produced by taking the germs into the body with\n",
      "food and drinking water.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACCESSORY CAUSES.--The usual method of introducing hog-cholera into a\n",
      "neighborhood is through the importation of feeding or breeding hogs that\n",
      "were infected with the disease before they were purchased, or became\n",
      "infected through exposure to the disease in the public stock-yards and\n",
      "stock-cars. The shipping of feeding hogs from one section of the country to\n",
      "another, and from public stock-yards, has always been productive of\n",
      "hog-cholera. Dr. Dorset states that more than fifty-seven per cent of the\n",
      "hog-cholera outbreaks are caused by visiting, exchanging work, exposure on\n",
      "adjoining farms and harboring the infection from year to year (Fig. 79),\n",
      "and more than twenty-three per cent to purchasing hogs and shipping in\n",
      "infected cars, birds and contaminated streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 79.--A hog yard where the disease-producing germs may\n",
      "be carried over from year to year.]\n",
      "\n",
      "In neighborhoods where outbreaks of hog-cholera occur necessary precautions\n",
      "against the spread of the disease are not taken. The _exchange of help_ at\n",
      "threshing and shredding time in neighborhoods where there is an outbreak of\n",
      "hog-cholera is the most common method of spreading the disease. _Visiting\n",
      "farms_ where hogs are dying of cholera; walking or driving a team and wagon\n",
      "through the cholera-infected yards; stock buyers, stock-food and\n",
      "cholera-remedy venders that visit the different farms in a neighborhood may\n",
      "distribute the hog-cholera virus through the infected filth that may adhere\n",
      "to the shoes, horses' feet and wagon wheels. _Cholera hogs_ may carry the\n",
      "disease directly to a healthy herd when allowed to run at large. _Streams_\n",
      "that are polluted with the drainage from cholera-infected yards are common\n",
      "sources of disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Pigeons, dogs, cows_ and _buzzards_ that travel about the neighborhood and\n",
      "feed in hog yards and on the carcasses of cholera hogs may distribute the\n",
      "disease. Because of the active part that dogs, birds and surface drainage\n",
      "take in the distribution of hog-cholera, the practice of allowing the\n",
      "carcasses of dead hogs to lie on the ground and decompose is responsible\n",
      "for a large percentage of the hog-cholera outbreaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Age_ is an important predisposing factor. Young hogs are most susceptible\n",
      "to cholera, and this susceptibility can be greatly increased by giving them\n",
      "crowded, filthy quarters. Infection with lice, lung and intestinal worms,\n",
      "the feeding of an improper ration and sudden changes in the ration lower\n",
      "the natural resistance of a hog against disease. Pampered hogs usually\n",
      "develop acute cholera when exposed to this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hog-cholera is more virulent or acute during the summer and fall months\n",
      "than it is during the winter and spring months. After the disease sweeps\n",
      "over a section of country, it becomes less virulent and takes on a subacute\n",
      "or chronic form. Outbreaks of hog-cholera usually last two or three years\n",
      "in a neighborhood. This depends largely on the number of susceptible hogs\n",
      "that were not exposed to the infection the first season, and the preventive\n",
      "precautions observed by the owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "PERIOD OF INCUBATION.--The length of time elapsing between the exposure of\n",
      "the hog to the cholera virus, and the development of noticeable symptoms of\n",
      "hog-cholera, varies from a few days to two or three weeks. The length of\n",
      "this incubation period depends on the susceptibility of the animal, the\n",
      "virulence of the virus and the method of exposure. An acute form of\n",
      "hog-cholera indicates a short period of incubation, and a chronic form, a\n",
      "long period.\n",
      "\n",
      "SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of hog-cholera may differ widely in the different\n",
      "outbreaks of the disease. The symptoms may be classified under the\n",
      "following forms: Acute, subacute and chronic. The acute form of hog-cholera\n",
      "is the most common. The early symptoms are tremors, fever, depressed\n",
      "appearance, marked weakness, staggering gait, constipation and diarrhoea,\n",
      "labored breathing and convulsions. Death may occur within a few hours or a\n",
      "few days. Recovery seldom occurs. In the subacute form, the symptoms are\n",
      "mild and develop slowly. Recovery may take place within a few days, or\n",
      "after extending over a week or ten days it may assume the chronic form.\n",
      "Very often in outbreaks of subacute cholera a large majority of the herd\n",
      "does not show visible symptoms of the disease. In the chronic form, marked\n",
      "symptoms of pleuropneumonia and chronic inflammation of the intestine are\n",
      "common. Ulcers and sores form on the skin and the hair may come off. Large\n",
      "portions of the skin may become gangrenous and slough. Young hogs are\n",
      "usually stunted and emaciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The first symptom_ of disease is an elevation of body temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of any outbreak of hog-cholera the _body temperatures_ of\n",
      "the apparently healthy animals may vary from 105\\260 to 108\\260 F. After\n",
      "a few days, animals that are fatally sick or recovering from the disease\n",
      "may show normal or subnormal body temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Loss of appetite_ is the first symptom of disease usually noted by the\n",
      "person in charge of the herd. The hog may show a disposition to eat dirt.\n",
      "The sick hog is usually found lying in its bed, or off by itself in a quiet\n",
      "place. It presents a rather _characteristic appearance_. The back is\n",
      "arched, the hind feet are held close together, or crossed, the abdomen is\n",
      "tucked up and the hog appears weak in its hind parts. _Diarrhoea_ or\n",
      "_constipation_ may be present. The color of the diarrhoeal discharges\n",
      "varies according to the character of the feed, and it may be more or less\n",
      "tinged with blood and have a disagreeable odor. The urine is highly\n",
      "colored.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The respirations and pulse beats_ are quickened and abnormal in character.\n",
      "Thumps sometimes occur. When the mucous membranes lining the throat and\n",
      "anterior air passages are thickened, the respirations are noisy and\n",
      "difficult. The animal may cough on getting up from its bed and moving\n",
      "about. There is at times a noticeable discharge from the nostrils. When the\n",
      "_lungs_ are inflamed the respirations are quickened and labored. In case\n",
      "the pleural membrane is inflamed, the respiratory symptoms are more severe,\n",
      "and the hog shows evidence of pain when the walls of the chest are pressed\n",
      "on. The _pericardium_ may be inflamed. In such cases the hog staggers and\n",
      "falls when forced to walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The central nervous system_ may be involved by the inflammation. The usual\n",
      "symptoms occurring in inflammation of the brain and its coverings are then\n",
      "present. A sleepy, comatose condition may end in death, or the animal dies\n",
      "in a convulsion.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The secretions of the skin_ and mucous membranes are abnormal. The skin in\n",
      "the regions of the ears, inside of the thighs and under surface of the body\n",
      "is moist, dirty or discolored red. Just before death the skin over the\n",
      "under surface of the body becomes a purplish red. In the chronic form, a\n",
      "dirty, thickened, wrinkled skin is commonly observed. At first the\n",
      "secretion from the eyes is thin and watery, but it becomes thick, heavy and\n",
      "pus-like, causing the margins of the lids to adhere to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The death rate in hog-cholera varies in the different forms of the disease.\n",
      "The average death rate is about fifty per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of hog-cholera in the field must\n",
      "depend on the clinical symptoms, post-mortem lesions and history of the\n",
      "outbreak. The history should be that of a highly infectious disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Carcass of a cholera hog showing different groups\n",
      "of lymphatic glands; kidneys; and ulcer on caecum.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_Abnormal body temperatures_ of a large percentage of the herd indicate the\n",
      "presence of an acute infectious disease. We should then destroy one of the\n",
      "sick hogs and make a careful post-mortem examination (Fig. 80). An early\n",
      "diagnosis of the disease is necessary, as this enables us to use curative\n",
      "treatment when it will do some good, and take the necessary steps toward\n",
      "preventing the spread of the disease to neighboring herds.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Intestinal and lung worms_ are common in young hogs. The presence of these\n",
      "worms does not always indicate that they are the cause of the sickness and\n",
      "death of the animal. Such parasites are injurious and may cause disease,\n",
      "but it is only in rare cases that they cause death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Pig typhoid_\" is sometimes spoken of as a highly infectious disease\n",
      "involving the intestines. A disease of hogs that may be termed typhus-fever\n",
      "sometimes affects a large number of the hogs in the herd. This disease\n",
      "occurs among hogs kept in small yards and houses that are crowded,\n",
      "unsanitary and in continuous use, or when the hogs drink from wallows,\n",
      "ponds and creeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term swine-plague should not be used in speaking of outbreaks of\n",
      "hog-cholera, as it is now considered a form of hog-cholera involving\n",
      "especially the lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Kidneys from hog that died of acute hog-cholera.]\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Lungs from hog that died of acute hog-cholera.]\n",
      "\n",
      "LESIONS.--In _acute hog-cholera_ the inflammation is hemorrhagic in\n",
      "character. Small, red spots and blotches occur in different organs and\n",
      "tissues. In the _chronic form_ of the disease ulceration of the intestinal\n",
      "and gastric mucous membrane, inflammation of the lungs and pleura and\n",
      "sloughing of the skin are common lesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The skin_ over the under side of the neck, body and inside of the thighs\n",
      "may appear red or purplish-red in color. The different groups of _lymphatic\n",
      "glands_ are enlarged and softened. They may vary in color from a\n",
      "grayish-red to a deep red, depending on the degree of engorgement with\n",
      "blood. The pleura and pericardium may show small red spots and blotches.\n",
      "The _kidneys_ are usually lighter colored than normal, and marked with red\n",
      "spots and blotches (Fig. 81). The _spleen_ may show no evidence of disease.\n",
      "It may be large and soft, or even smaller than normal. The _liver_ may be\n",
      "enlarged and dark, or mottled and light colored.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _stomach_ and _intestines_ may show hemorrhagic spots and blotches.\n",
      "Sometimes the gastric and intestinal mucous membrane is a brick red.\n",
      "Ulceration of the mucous membrane is common (Fig. 83).\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 83.--A piece of intestine from a hog that died of\n",
      "chronic hog-cholera, showing appearance of intestinal ulcers.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Small, red spots may be present on the surface of the _lungs_ (Fig. 82).\n",
      "Scattered lung lobules or a large portion of the lungs may be inflamed. In\n",
      "chronic hog-cholera, pleural exudation, adhesions and abscesses in the lung\n",
      "tissue may occur. Inflammations of the pericardium and heart muscle are\n",
      "less common lesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "PREVENTIVE MEASURES.--Hog-cholera is the most widespread infectious disease\n",
      "of hogs, and all possible precautions against its distribution to healthy\n",
      "herds should be practised. Hogs coming from other herds and stock shows\n",
      "should be excluded from the home herd until they are positively shown to be\n",
      "free from disease. They should be quarantined in yards set off for this\n",
      "purpose. The hogs should be cleaned by dipping or washing them with a\n",
      "disinfectant. The quarantine period should be longer than the average\n",
      "period of incubation. Three weeks is sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The possible introduction of the disease_ into the pens by people, dogs,\n",
      "birds and other carriers of the disease should be guarded against,\n",
      "especially if cholera is present in the neighborhood. The exchange of help\n",
      "at threshing and shredding time with a neighbor who has hog-cholera on his\n",
      "farm is a common method of distributing the infection. It is not advisable\n",
      "to allow a stranger to enter your hog-houses and yards, unless his shoes\n",
      "are first disinfected. Whenever it is necessary for a person to enter yards\n",
      "where the disease is present, the shoes should be cleaned and disinfected\n",
      "on leaving. The wheels of wagons, and the feet of horses that are driven\n",
      "through cholera yards, should be washed with a disinfectant. The feet of\n",
      "feeding cattle that are shipped from stock-yards should be treated in the\n",
      "same manner. Persons taking care of cholera hogs should observe the\n",
      "necessary precautions against the distribution of the disease, and see that\n",
      "others practise like precautions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hog-yards should be well drained and all wallow holes filled. Pens and\n",
      "pastures through which the drainage from the swine enclosures higher up\n",
      "flows should not be used for hogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARE OF A DISEASED HERD.--When an outbreak of hog-cholera occurs on a farm\n",
      "the farm should be quarantined. The herd should be moved away from running\n",
      "streams, public roads and line fences, so that neighboring herds are not\n",
      "unnecessarily exposed to the disease. During the hot weather shade and an\n",
      "opportunity to range over a grass lot or pasture are highly necessary. A\n",
      "recently mowed meadow, or a blue grass pasture and a low shed, open on all\n",
      "sides and amply large for the herd to lie under, give the animals clean\n",
      "range and comfortable, cool quarters. Roomy, dry, well-ventilated\n",
      "sleeping-quarters that are free from drafts and can be cleaned and\n",
      "disinfected are best when the weather is cold and wet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the subacute, and in the early part of an acute outbreak of hog-cholera,\n",
      "it is advisable to separate the sick from the well hogs. The fatally sick\n",
      "animals should be destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Cleaning up a hog lot.]\n",
      "\n",
      "A very light ration should be fed and an intestinal antiseptic given with\n",
      "the feed. A thin slop of shorts is usually preferred. Four ounces of\n",
      "pulverized copper sulfate may be dissolved in one gallon of hot water, and\n",
      "one quart of this solution may be added to every ten gallons of drinking\n",
      "water and slop. Water and slop should not be left in the troughs for the\n",
      "hogs to wallow in. The troughs should be disinfected and turned bottom side\n",
      "up as soon as the hogs have finished feeding and drinking. Kitchen slop and\n",
      "sour milk should not be fed. The care and treatment of the herd require\n",
      "work and close attention on the part of the attendant. Indifferent,\n",
      "careless treatment is of no use in this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "A disinfectant should be sprayed or sprinkled about the feed troughs,\n",
      "floors, pens and sleeping quarters daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISPOSING OF DEAD HOGS.--The carcasses of the dead hogs should be burned.\n",
      "Before placing the carcass on the fire, it should be cut open and several\n",
      "long incisions made through the skin. A crematory may be made by digging\n",
      "two cross trenches that are about one foot deep at the point where they\n",
      "cross, and shallow at the ends. Iron bars or pipe may be laid over the\n",
      "trenches where they cross for the carcass to rest upon, or woven wire\n",

      "\n",
      "HISTORY.--Tuberculosis is one of the oldest of known diseases of domestic\n",
      "animals and man. Its contagious character was proven by Villemin in 1865,\n",
      "who by experential infection transmitted tuberculosis from man to animals\n",
      "and from animal to animal. It was in 1882 that Dr. Robert Koch discovered\n",
      "and proved by inoculation experiments that the disease was caused by a\n",
      "specific germ (Fig. 88). Prior to the experiments by Villemin and Koch, the\n",
      "belief was that tuberculosis was due to heredity, unsanitary conditions and\n",
      "inbreeding. Following discovery of the specific germ and conditions\n",
      "favoring its development and spread, numerous scientifically conducted\n",
      "experiments were made. These resulted in practical methods of control and\n",
      "elimination of tuberculosis from herds having this disease. By carefully\n",
      "conducted experiments and other forms of educational work the infectious\n",
      "character of tuberculosis and the economic importance of preventative\n",
      "measures have been demonstrated. The average stockman is well informed\n",
      "regarding the character and economic importance of this disease, but there\n",
      "is no general application of this knowledge, and tuberculosis is increasing\n",
      "in dairy and breeding herds. The slow development of tuberculosis, and the\n",
      "absence of visible symptoms during the early stage of the disease, are\n",
      "responsible for this condition and the extensive infection of dairy and\n",
      "breeding herds.\n",
      "\n",
      "PREVALENCE OF THE DISEASE.--Tuberculosis is very prevalent among cattle and\n",
      "swine in all countries where intensive agriculture is practised. It is a\n",
      "rare disease among cattle of the steppes of eastern Europe and the cattle\n",
      "ranges of the western portion of the United States. In countries where\n",
      "dairying is an important industry, tuberculosis is a common disease of\n",
      "cattle and hogs. The abattoir reports of Europe and the United States show\n",
      "that tuberculosis is on the increase among domestic animals. The Bureau of\n",
      "Animal Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture reports that\n",
      "out of 400,008 cattle tested with tuberculin 9.25 per cent reacted. Melvin\n",
      "states that the annual loss from tuberculosis in the United States is about\n",
      "$23,000,000. In dairy herds in which the disease has existed for several\n",
      "years, it is not uncommon to find from 25 to 75 per cent tubercular.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE DIRECT CAUSE.--The direct cause of tuberculosis is Koch's _Bacillus\n",
      "tuberculosis_. This is a slender, rod-shaped microorganisms (Fig. 88)\n",
      "occurring in the diseased tissues, feces and milk of a tubercular animal.\n",
      "It belongs to that small group known as acid-fast bacteria. The tubercle\n",
      "bacillus is not really destroyed by external influences, and it may retain\n",
      "its virulence for several months in dried sputum if protected from the\n",
      "light. Its vitality enables it to resist high temperatures, changes in\n",
      "temperature, drying and putrefaction to a, greater degree than most\n",
      "non-spore-producing germs. Direct sunlight destroys the germ within a few\n",
      "hours, but it may live in poorly lighted, filthy stables for months. A\n",
      "temperature of 65\\260 C. destroys it in a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animals that, have advanced or open tuberculosis may disseminate the germ\n",
      "of the disease in the discharge from the mouth, nostrils, genital organs,\n",
      "in the intestinal excreta and milk. The germs discharged from the mouth and\n",
      "nostrils are coughed up from the lungs and may infect the feed. Milk is a\n",
      "common source of infection for calves and hogs. Allowing hogs to run after\n",
      "cattle is sure to result in infection of a large percentage of them, if\n",
      "there are any open cases of tuberculosis in the herd.\n",
      "\n",
      "PREDISPOSING CAUSES.--Any condition that may lessen the resistance of the\n",
      "body or enable the tubercle bacillus to survive the exposure outside the\n",
      "body favors the development of the disease and the infection of the healthy\n",
      "animals. Crowded, poorly ventilated, filthy stables lower the\n",
      "disease-resisting power of the animal, and favor the entrance of the germs\n",
      "into the body. Under such unsanitary conditions, tuberculosis spreads\n",
      "quickly among dairy cattle, and a large percentage of the animals develop\n",
      "the generalized form of the disease. Sanitary stables and yards do not\n",
      "prevent the spread of the disease among animals that live in close contact\n",
      "with one another. Fresh air and sanitary surroundings only check the spread\n",
      "and retard its progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION OF TUBERCULOSIS INTO THE HERD.--The common method of\n",
      "introducing tuberculosis into the herd is through the purchase of animals\n",
      "having the disease. Such animals may be in apparent good health at the time\n",
      "of purchase, and be affected with generalized or open tuberculosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "_A source of infection_ is by unknowingly buying cows that have reacted to\n",
      "the tuberculin test. The indiscriminate use and sale of tuberculin are\n",
      "largely responsible for the large number of reacting animals that have been\n",
      "placed on the open market. This dishonest practice has resulted in the\n",
      "rapid spread of the disease in certain localities. For years a large\n",
      "percentage of the breeding herds have been infected, and the writer has met\n",
      "with several herds of dairy and beef cattle that became tubercular through\n",
      "the purchase of tubercular breeding animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "SYMPTOMS.--There is no one symptom by which we may recognize tuberculosis\n",
      "in cattle and hogs. None of the symptoms shown by a tubercular animal are\n",
      "characteristic, unless it is in the late stage of the disease. In a\n",
      "well-cared-for animal, the lymphatic glands in the different regions of the\n",
      "body, the lungs, liver and other organs, may be full of tubercles without\n",
      "causing noticeable symptoms of disease (Fig. 89).\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 89.--A tubercular cow. This cow was, to all\n",
      "appearances, in good health, but showed generalized tuberculosis on\n",
      "post-mortem examination.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_Tuberculosis may attack any organ of the body_, and in the different cases\n",
      "of the disease the symptoms may vary. Enlargement of the glands in the\n",
      "region of the throat, and noisy, difficult breathing are sometimes present.\n",
      "The udder frequently shows hard lumps scattered through the gland. Bloating\n",
      "may occur if a diseased gland in the chest cavity presses on the oesophagus\n",
      "and prevents the usual passage of gas from the paunch. Chronic diarrhoea\n",
      "may occur. If the disease involves the digestive tract, the animal is\n",
      "unthrifty and loses flesh rapidly. Coughing is not a characteristic\n",
      "symptom, and we should not place too much emphasis on it. If the lungs\n",
      "become tubercular the animal usually has a slight, harsh cough. The cough\n",
      "is first noticed when the cattle get up after lying down, when the stable\n",
      "is first opened in the morning and when the animals are driven. If the\n",
      "chest walls are thin, soreness from pressure on the ribs may be noted. By\n",
      "applying the ear to the chest wall and listening to the lung sounds,\n",
      "absence of respiratory murmurs and abnormal sounds may be distinguished,\n",
      "due to consolidation of the lung tissue, abscess cavities and pleural\n",
      "adhesions. In a well-advanced case the hair is rough, the skin becomes\n",
      "tight and the neck thin and lean. The animal may breathe through the mouth\n",
      "when it is exercised. Weakness may be a prominent symptom.\n",
      "\n",

      "Breeding animals that are well fed and cared for may live for several years\n",

      "more rapidly in milch cows, especially if given poor care. Calves allowed\n",
      "to nurse a tubercular mother that is giving off tubercle bacilli frequently\n",
      "develop enlarged throat glands and the intestinal form of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hogs develop a generalized form of tuberculosis more quickly than cattle,\n",
      "but an unthrifty, emaciated condition is seldom noted in hogs under ten\n",
      "months old.\n",
      "\n",
      "POST-MORTEM LESIONS.--The effect of the tubercle bacillus on the body is to\n",
      "irritate and destroy the tissues. Lumps or tubercles form in the lymphatic\n",
      "glands, liver, lungs, spleen (Fig. 90), serous membranes, kidneys and other\n",
      "body organs (Figs. 91 and 92). The tubercles may be very small at first,\n",
      "but as the disease progresses they continue to enlarge until finally a\n",
      "tubercular mass the size of a base-ball, or larger, is formed (Figs. 93,\n",
      "94, 95 and 96). Lymphatic glands may become several times larger than\n",
      "normal and the liver and lungs greatly enlarged. The pleura and peritoneum\n",
      "may be thickened and covered with tubercles about the size of a millet\n",
      "seed, or larger. Pleural and peritoneal adhesions to the organs within the\n",
      "body cavities are common.\n",

      "STRANGLES. DISTEMPER.--This is an acute infectious disease associated with\n",
      "a catarrhal condition of the air-passages and suppuration of the lymphatic\n",
      "glands in the region of the throat. Colts are the most susceptible to the\n",
      "disease. One attack renders the animal immune against a second attack of\n",
      "the disease, but the immunity is not always permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause_, _Streptococcus equi_ (Fig. 113), was discovered by\n",
      "Schutz in 1888. Strangles is commonly spread by exposing susceptible\n",
      "animals to diseased animals, either by direct contact, or by exposing them\n",
      "to the infection in the stable and allowing them to drink or eat food from\n",
      "watering and feeding troughs on premises where the disease exists. The\n",
      "predisposing causes are cold and sudden changes in the weather. For this\n",
      "reason the disease is most prevalent during the late winter and early\n",
      "spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Streptococcus of strangles.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The period of incubation varies_, usually from four to eight days.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ at the beginning of the attack are a feverish condition and\n",
      "partial loss of appetite. The visible mucous membranes are red and dry.\n",
      "This is followed by watery nasal secretions that become heavy and purulent\n",
      "within a few days. The inflammation may extend to the larynx and pharynx.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glands in the region of the jaw become hot, swollen and painful, and\n",
      "the animal may be unable to eat or drink. The swelling and inflammation of\n",
      "the throat, and the heavy, pus-like secretions that accumulate in the nasal\n",
      "cavities, cause difficult respirations. After a few days the abscesses\n",
      "usually break, and the symptoms are less severe. If the abscesses break on\n",
      "the inside of the throat, the discharge from the nostrils is increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disease may be accompanied by an eruption of nodules, or vesicles on\n",
      "the skin, or nasal mucous membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "In severe and chronic cases multiple abscesses may form. This complication\n",
      "is indicated by emaciation and weakness. Such cases usually terminate in\n",
      "death. Severe inflammation and swelling in the region of the throat may\n",
      "terminate in strangulation and death. The death-rate is from one to three\n",
      "per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in using all possible precautions to\n",
      "prevent the exposure of susceptible animals and practising the immunization\n",
      "of exposed animals. The curative treatment is principally careful nursing.\n",
      "Rest, a comfortable stall, nourishing feed and good care constitute the\n",
      "necessary treatment for the average case of distemper. When the abscesses\n",
      "become mature, they should be opened and washed with a disinfectant.\n",
      "Steaming the animal several times daily relieves difficult breathing and\n",
      "the irritated condition of the mucous membranes. In case the abscesses do\n",
      "not form promptly and the throat is badly swollen, a blistering ointment or\n",
      "liniment may be applied. Bitter and saline tonics, the same as recommended\n",

      "\n",
      "INFLUENZA (CATARRHAL OR SHIPPING FEVER).--This is a well-known acute\n",
      "infectious disease of solipeds. It is characterized by depression, high\n",
      "body temperature and catarrhal inflammation of the respiratory and other\n",
      "mucous membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several epidemics of influenza have occurred in the United States. The most\n",
      "serious epidemic occurred in the latter part of the '70's, and the last one\n",
      "in 1900-'01. Influenza is present in the principal horse centers in a\n",
      "somewhat attenuated form.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause_ of the disease has never been determined. The virus is\n",
      "present in the expired air, nasal secretions and excreta. Close proximity\n",
      "to a diseased animal is not necessary in order to contract the disease.\n",
      "Stables may harbor the infection, and it may be distributed by such disease\n",
      "carriers as blankets, harness, clothing of the attendant and dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The predisposing causes_ are cold, exposure and changes in climate. When\n",
      "the disease appears in a country, it is first present in the large cities,\n",
      "and from there it is scattered to the outlying districts. The _period of\n",
      "incubation_ is usually from four to seven days.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The early symptoms_ of the disease are a high fever, marked depression and\n",
      "partial or entire loss of appetite. The horse usually stands in the stall\n",
      "with the head down and appears sleepy. The visible and respiratory mucous\n",
      "membranes are inflamed, the respirations are quickened and the animal may\n",
      "cough. The eyes are frequently affected, the lids and cornea showing more\n",
      "or less inflammation. The digestive tract may be affected. At the\n",
      "beginning, colicky pains may be present and later constipation and\n",
      "diarrhoea. Symptoms of a serious nervous disturbance are sometimes\n",
      "manifested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The limbs usually become swollen or filled. This disappears as the animal\n",
      "begins to improve. Pregnant mares may abort. The death-rate is low.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment required for the sick animals_ is largely rest, a light diet\n",
      "and a comfortable, clean, well-ventilated stall, free from draughts.\n",
      "Windows in the stall should be darkened. If the stable is cold, the body of\n",
      "the animal should be covered with a blanket and the limbs bandaged. Two\n",
      "ounces of alcohol and one drachm of quinine may be given three or four\n",
      "times daily. Small doses of raw linseed oil may be given if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horses that are exposed to cold, wet weather or worked after becoming sick,\n",
      "frequently suffer from pneumonia, pericarditis, gastro-enteritis and other\n",
      "diseases. Such complications should be given prompt treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very advisable to give a protective serum to horses that are shipped\n",

      "nasal mucous membrane and lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although glanders is one of the oldest of animal diseases, it was not until\n",
      "1868 that its contagious character was demonstrated. The disease is widely\n",
      "distributed. It became more prevalent in the United States after the Civil\n",
      "War. The vigorous control measures practised by the State and Federal\n",
      "health officers have greatly decreased the percentage of animals affected\n",
      "with glanders. At the present time the disease is more often met with in\n",
      "the large cities than in the agricultural sections of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 114.--_Bacillus mallei_.]\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause of glanders is the Bacillus mallei_ (Fig. 114). This\n",
      "microorganism was discovered in 1882. It is present in the discharges from\n",
      "the nasal mucous membrane and the ulcers. These discharges may become\n",
      "deposited upon the feed troughs, mangers, stalls, harness, buckets,\n",
      "watering troughs, drinking fountains and attendants' hands and clothing.\n",
      "Healthy horses living in the same stable with the glandered animals may\n",
      "escape infection for months. It is usually the diseased animal's mate, or\n",
      "the one standing in an adjoining stall, that is first affected. Catarrhal\n",
      "diseases predispose animals to glanders, as the normal resistance of the\n",
      "mucous membranes is thereby reduced. The most common routes by which the\n",
      "germ enters the body are by way of the digestive and respiratory tracts. It\n",
      "may enter the body through the uninjured mucous membranes of the\n",
      "respiratory tract and genital organs, or through wounds of the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The period of incubation_ may be from a few to many days.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ may be _acute_ or _chronic_ in nature. The _acute form_\n",
      "pursues a rapid course. It is frequently seen in mules and asses, and it\n",
      "may develop from the subacute or chronic form in horses. When the disease\n",
      "is acute, the animal has a fever, is stupid, does not eat, and may have a\n",
      "diarrhoea. In this form the lymphatic glands suppurate, the animal loses\n",
      "flesh rapidly and dies in from one to two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Nasal septum showing nodules and ulcers.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The _chronic form_ is the most common. It develops slowly and lasts for\n",
      "years. The early symptoms of the disease (chilling and fever) usually\n",
      "escape notice. The first visible symptom is a nasal discharge of a dirty\n",
      "white color from one or both nostrils. This is usually scanty at first, and\n",
      "intermittent, but later becomes quite abundant. The discharge is very\n",
      "sticky, and adheres to the hair and skin. The most frequent seat of the\n",
      "disease is in the respiratory organs, lymph glands and skin. Nodules and\n",
      "ulcers appear on the nasal mucous membrane (Fig. 115), but they may be so\n",
      "high up as to escape notice. The ulcers are very characteristic of the\n",
      "disease. They are angry looking, with ragged, raised margins, and when they\n",
      "heal leave a puckered scar. The submaxillary glands may be enlarged, and at\n",
      "first more or less hard and painful, but later they become nodular and\n",
      "adhere to the jaw or skin. Nodules and ulcers may form on the skin over the\n",
      "inferior wall of the abdomen and the inside of the hind limbs and are known\n",
      "as \"farcy buds.\" Lymphatic vessels near these buds become swollen and hard.\n",
      "The animal loses flesh rapidly, does not withstand hard work, and the limbs\n",
      "usually swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is sometimes difficult to diagnose the disease. The ulcers on the nasal\n",
      "mucous membranes and elsewhere are very characteristic, and when present\n",
      "enable the examiner to form a diagnosis. In cases of doubt, a\n",
      "bacteriological examination of the nasal discharge may be made, or we may\n",
      "resort to one or several of the various diagnostic tests. The Mallein test\n",
      "is quite commonly used. The sterilized products of a culture of the _B.\n",
      "mallei_ are injected beneath the skin of the suspected animal. This causes\n",
      "a rise in body temperature and a hot, characteristic swelling at the point\n",
      "of injection in glandered animals.\n",

      "ACTINOMYCOSIS, \"LUMPY JAW.\"--This is an infectious disease that is\n",
      "characterized by the formation of tumors and abscesses (Fig. 117), and the\n",
      "destruction of the infected tissues. The disease is common in cattle and\n",
      "usually affects the bones and soft parts of the head. In the United States,\n",
      "where the disease is known as \"lumpy jaw\" the jawbone is commonly affected.\n",
      "In European countries the disease frequently involves the tongue, and the\n",
      "term \"wooden tongue\" is applied to it. The disease may affect regions of\n",
      "the body other than the head. Actinomycosis of the lungs sometimes occurs.\n",
      "Swine and horses may be affected by this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause_ of actinomycosis is commonly known as the ray fungus\n",
      "(Fig. 118). This fungus grows on certain plants, and the animal usually\n",
      "contracts the disease by eating plants or roughage that have the fungus on\n",
      "them. Grasses having awns that are capable of wounding the mucous membrane\n",
      "of the mouth and penetrating the gums are most apt to produce the disease.\n",
      "Young cattle that are replacing and erupting their teeth are most prone to\n",
      "\"lumpy jaw.\" Conditions that favor bruising of the jaw and external wounds\n",
      "favor the development of actinomycosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fungus grows in the tissues, causing an inflammatory reaction and\n",
      "destruction of the tissue. The ray fungus can be seen in the diseased\n",
      "tissue or the pus as yellowish, spherical bodies about the size of a grain\n",
      "of sand. Each of these bodies is formed by a large number of club-like\n",
      "bodies arranged about a central mass of filaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 118.--The ray fungus.]\n",

      "the soft tissues of the head. If the jawbone is affected the tumor feels\n",
      "hard and cannot be moved about. Sometimes it is soft and filled with pus.\n",
      "Tumors of long standing may possess uneven, nodular surfaces and fistulous\n",
      "openings. When the tongue is affected, it is swollen and painful, and\n",
      "prehension and mastication of the food may be impossible. When the pharynx\n",
      "is the seat of disease, breathing and swallowing are difficult and painful.\n",
      "Actinomycosis of the lungs may present the appearance of a chronic\n",
      "pulmonary affection. If the disease involves the head and lungs, the animal\n",
      "may become unthrifty and emaciated. In doubtful cases a microscopic\n",
      "examination of a piece of the tumor, or some of the pus, may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment is surgical and medicinal_. Small, external tumors may be\n",
      "removed by an operation. Sometimes an incision is made into the diseased\n",
      "tissue and a caustic preparation introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most desirable method of treatment is the administration of large doses\n",
      "of iodide of potassium in a drench, or in the drinking water. The dose is\n",
      "from one to three drachms daily for a period of seven to fourteen days. The\n",
      "size of the dose depends on the size of the animal and its susceptibility\n",
      "to iodism. An animal weighing 1000 pounds may be given two drachms. The\n",
      "treatment is kept up until the symptoms of iodism develop. The condition is\n",
      "indicated by a loss of appetite and a catarrhal discharge from the eyes and\n",
      "nostrils. When this occurs, the treatment should be stopped, and the animal\n",
      "drenched with one-half pound of Epsom salts, and the dose repeated after\n",

      "_The symptoms_ of black leg develop quickly and may terminate fatally in a\n",
      "few hours. These are general dulness, stiffness, prostration and loss of\n",
      "appetite. Lameness is a prominent symptom. The animal may show a swelling\n",
      "in the regions of the shoulder and hindquarters or on other parts of the\n",
      "body. The swelling is very hot and painful at first, but if the animal\n",
      "lives for a time, it becomes less tender, crackles when pressed on and the\n",
      "skin may feel cold and leathery. Fever is a constant symptom. In the highly\n",

      "occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The tissue changes_ in the region of the swelling are characteristic. An\n",

      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in thoroughly draining pastures and\n",
      "yards where cattle run. This measure does not insure cattle against the\n",
      "disease. Cattle that die of \"black leg\" should be cremated. This should be\n",
      "done at the spot where the animal dies. If the carcass is moved or opened,\n",

      "a cresol disinfectant and covered with lime.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Vaccination_ of the exposed or susceptible animals should be practised. On\n",
      "farms where the disease exists it may be necessary to vaccinate the young\n",

      "TEXAS OR TICK FEVER.--Tick fever is an infectious disease of cattle. It is\n",
      "caused by an animal organism that is present in the blood, and is conveyed\n",
      "from the animal that is host for the tick fever parasite to the\n",
      "non-infected animal by a tick (Figs. 120 and 121).\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Cattle tick (female).]\n",
      "\n",
      "Tick fever was introduced into the southern portion of the United States\n",
      "through importation of cattle by the Spaniards. Previous to the\n",
      "establishing of a definite quarantine line between the permanently infected\n",
      "and the non-infected sections, heavy losses among northern cattle resulted\n",
      "through driving and shipping southern cattle through the northern States.\n",
      "The specific cause and the part taken by the tick in its distribution were\n",
      "not discovered until 1889-'90. Smith recognized and discovered the specific\n",
      "cause of the disease, and Kilborn and Salmon proved by a series of\n",
      "experiments that the cattle tick was responsible for the transmission of\n",
      "the disease from animal to animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause_ of tick fever is a protozoan parasite, _Piroplasma\n",
      "bigeminum_ (Fig. 122). It is present in the blood of cattle that are\n",
      "affected with this disease. The natural method of entrance into the body is\n",
      "through the bite of the cattle tick. The disease may be transmitted by\n",
      "inoculating blood containing the parasite into a susceptible animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two forms of the disease, the _acute_ and _chronic_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms of the acute form_ of the disease are a high fever,\n",
      "depression, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, dark or bloody urine, staggering\n",
      "gait and delirium. Death may occur within a few days from the time the\n",
      "first symptoms are manifested.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms of the chronic form_ of the disease resemble the acute form,\n",
      "but are more mild. The animal is unthrifty and loses flesh rapidly. The\n",
      "bloodless condition of the body is manifested by the pale, visible mucous\n",
      "membrane. Death seldom occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Blood-cells with _Piroplasma bigeminum_ in them.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The most characteristic _diseased changes_ found on post-mortem examination\n",
      "occur in the liver and spleen. The liver is enlarged, and a yellowish,\n",
      "mahogany-brown color. The gallbladder is filled with a very thick bile. The\n",
      "spleen may be several times the normal size and dark colored. When it is\n",
      "cut into, the pulpy tissue may resemble thick, dark blood. The kidneys are\n",
      "pale and the bladder may contain dark or reddish-colored urine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the northern States and outside of the quarantined area, the direct or\n",
      "indirect exposure of the affected cattle to southern cattle, and the\n",

      "evidence to confirm the diagnosis of this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The prevention and control_ depend on destruction of the cattle tick. In\n",
      "the early history of the disease, shipping and driving of southern cattle\n",
      "into and through the northern States caused outbreaks of tick fever and\n",
      "heavy losses among northern cattle. This finally resulted in the locating\n",
      "of the infected district, and the establishment of the Texas-fever\n",
      "quarantine line in 1891 by Dr. D. E. Salmon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous to this time Kilborne and Salmon proved that the cattle tick was\n",
      "essential to the spread and production of the disease. A further study of\n",
      "the life history of the tick resulted in the discovery that it could not\n",
      "mature unless it became a parasite of horses, mules, or cattle. This has\n",
      "led to the eradication of the tick in certain sections of the South, by not\n",
      "allowing cattle access to a pasture or lot for a certain period, and by\n",
      "freeing the animals from ticks by hand-picking, dipping and smearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The immunization of cattle that are shipped into an infected district for\n",
      "breeding purposes is often practised. Immunity is obtained by introducing\n",
      "the P. bigeminun into the blood, either by placing a few virulent young\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FOWL CHOLERA.--This is a highly infectious disease of all species of\n",
      "poultry, that is characterized by weakness, depression and yellowish\n",
      "colored excrement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _specific cause_ of fowl cholera is the _Bacillus avisepticus_ (Fig.\n",
      "123). This microorganism is transmitted to the healthy birds by the feed,\n",
      "or water becoming contaminated with the discharges from the diseased birds.\n",
      "According to Salmon, the period of incubating varies from four to twenty\n",
      "days.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The early symptoms_ are a falling off in appetite, high fever, dulness,\n",
      "diarrhoea and weakness. The affected bird becomes drowsy, the head is drawn\n",
      "toward the body, and it may remain asleep for long periods at a time.\n",
      "Salmon states that the general outline of the sick bird becomes spherical\n",
      "or ball-shaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FIG. 123.--_Bacillus avisepticus_.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The disease is usually highly fatal. In the acute form the larger portion\n",
      "of the flock may die off within a week. In the subacute and chronic forms,\n",
      "the birds become greatly emaciated, and a few die off weekly through a\n",
      "period of a month or longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The tissue changes_ occurring in the disease are inflammation of all or a\n",
      "few of the internal organs. Ward states that the most characteristic lesion\n",
      "of fowl cholera is the severe inflammation of that portion of the small\n",
      "intestine nearest to the gizzard. Small hemorrhagic spots may be found on\n",
      "the heart and other organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment is both preventive and curative_. The preventive treatment\n",
      "consists in quarantining newly purchased birds until we are satisfied that\n",
      "they are free from disease. The occasional disinfection of the poultry\n",
      "houses and runs is highly important. Cleaning the poultry house by removing\n",
      "the floor, roosts, or any part of the house for the purpose of removing all\n",
      "filth, and spraying the interior with a three per cent water solution of a\n",
      "cresol disinfectant, should be practised. Lime should be scattered over the\n",
      "runs, or the yards immediately about the house. The above preventive\n",
      "measures form an important part of the care and management of the flock.\n",
      "The carcasses of the dead birds should be burned. It is advisable to kill\n",
      "all birds that are fatally sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the flock should be given antiseptics with the feed and water. Four\n",
      "ounces of a water solution of copper sulfate, made by dissolving\n",
      "one-quarter pound of this drug in one gallon of hot water, may be added to\n",
      "each gallon of drinking water. Frequent disinfection of the drinking\n",
      "fountains, feeding places and houses should be practised.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISEASES RESEMBLING FOWL CHOLERA.--There are a few diseases, such as\n",
      "septicaemia, limber neck and infectious enteritis, that are sometimes\n",
      "mistaken for fowl cholera. These diseases are caused by different\n",
      "microorganisms that may be found in the digestive tract and air-passages of\n",
      "healthy birds, insanitary conditions and decomposed feed, especially meat.\n",
      "It seems that under certain conditions, such as insanitary quarters and\n",
      "birds that are low in constitutional vigor and weakened from other causes,\n",
      "certain germs may become disease-producers. The death rate from mixed\n",
      "infections is very heavy in poultry.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ vary in the different cases. The disease may be highly\n",
      "acute, as in limber neck, or chronic, extending over a period of a week or\n",
      "more. Diarrhoea is not a prominent symptom in the majority of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The post-mortem lesions vary from a hemorrhagic to a chronic inflammation\n",
      "of the different body organs and serous membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is preventive. A frequent cleaning and disinfecting of the\n",
      "poultry house and surroundings, avoiding the feeding of spoiled feed, or\n",
      "allowing the drinking fountains and feeding places to become filthy, are\n",
      "effective preventive measures. Sick birds should be either isolated and\n",
      "quarantined, or destroyed. Antiseptics may be given with the feed and\n",
      "drinking water.\n",
      "\n",
      "AVIAN DIPHTHERIA (ROUP).--This infectious disease of poultry is especially\n",
      "common in chickens. It is characterized by a catarrhal and diphtheritic\n",
      "inflammation of the mucous membranes of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause of roup_ has not been determined. The disease-producing\n",
      "germs are present in the discharges from the nostrils, eyes and mouth, and\n",
      "the body excretions of sick birds. Birds having a mild form of roup, or\n",
      "that have recently recovered from it, are common carriers of the disease.\n",
      "The disease is usually introduced into the flock by allowing birds exposed\n",
      "at poultry shows, or recently purchased breeding stock from an infected\n",
      "flock, to mix with the healthy birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The predisposing causes_ are very important factors in the development of\n",
      "roup. Cold, damp, draughty, poorly ventilated poultry houses cause the\n",
      "disease to spread rapidly and become highly acute.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ differ in character in the different outbreaks of the\n",
      "disease. Usually the first symptoms noticed are sneezing, dulness,\n",
      "diminished appetite and a watery discharge from the nostrils and eyes.\n",
      "Later the eyelids may become swollen and the nostrils plugged by the\n",
      "discharge from the inflamed membranes. If the mouth is examined at this\n",
      "time, an accumulation of mucus and patches of diphtheritic or false\n",
      "membranes are found. In the acute form of roup the false membranes and\n",
      "yellowish, cheesy-like material accumulate on the different mucous\n",
      "membranes, and interfere with vision, breathing and digestion. The affected\n",
      "bird becomes thin and weak. The death rate is very high in this form of the\n",
      "disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The preventive treatment_ consists in quarantining birds that have been\n",
      "purchased from other flocks, and that have been exhibited, for a period of\n",
      "three weeks. A careful examination of the mouth should be made. If a\n",
      "catarrhal discharge from the nostrils and false membranes is present,\n",
      "prompt treatment should be used. A sick bird should be held in quarantine\n",
      "for several weeks after it has recovered, and receive a thorough washing in\n",
      "a two per cent water solution of a cresol disinfectant before allowing it\n",
      "to mix with the healthy birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The medicinal treatment consists in removing the discharges from the\n",
      "nostrils and eyes with pledgets of absorbent cotton that are soaked with a\n",
      "four per cent water solution of boric acid. Among the common treatments\n",
      "mentioned are boric acid and calomel, equal parts by weight, blown into the\n",
      "nostrils and eyes with a powder blower. Water solutions of boric acid,\n",
      "potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide are recommended. Liquid\n",
      "preparations are applied with pledgets of cotton, oil cans, or atomizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many recoveries can be obtained with careful treatment. It is usually most\n",
      "economical to kill the severely affected birds. Many poultrymen dispose of\n",
      "the entire flock as soon as the disease makes its appearance, and clean and\n",
      "disinfect the premises before restocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHICKENPOX.--In some sections the disease appears in another form, known as\n",
      "_chickenpox_ (contagious epithelioma), in which nodules form on the skin\n",
      "along the base of the comb and other parts of the head, or both forms may\n",
      "be met with in the same flock. The nodules should be treated with vaseline,\n",
      "or glycerine ointments containing two per cent of any of the common\n",
      "antiseptics or disinfectants.\n",
      "\n",
      "ENTERO-HEPATITIS. \"BLACKHEAD.\"--This is a very fatal disease of young\n",
      "turkeys. Grown turkeys and other fowls are not so susceptible to the\n",
      "disease. It is characterized by an inflammation of the liver and\n",
      "intestines, especially the caeca.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The specific cause_ is a protozoan microorganism, _Amoeba meleagridis_.\n",
      "Adult fowls and turkeys may act as carriers of the germ, and the young\n",
      "turkeys become infected at an early period.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are diminished or lost appetite, dulness, drooped wings,\n",
      "diarrhoea, weakness and death. When the disease becomes well advanced, the\n",
      "head and comb become dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The course of the disease_ is from a few weeks to three months. Very few\n",
      "of the young turkeys survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The treatment_ is almost entirely preventive. The same precautionary\n",
      "measures for the prevention of the introduction of disease into the flock,\n",
      "recommended in other infectious diseases, should be practised. Turkeys that\n",
      "survive should be disposed of. As chickens may harbor the disease-producing\n",
      "germs, we should not attempt to raise turkeys in the same quarters with\n",
      "them. Eggs should be obtained from disease-free flocks. Wiping the eggs\n",
      "with a cloth wet with fifty per cent alcohol may be practised. The same\n",
      "recommendations regarding the cleaning and disinfecting of the quarters\n",
      "described in the treatment of fowl cholera should be practised.\n",
      "\n",
      "If an outbreak of the disease occurs in the flock all of the sick birds\n",
      "should be killed, and their carcasses cremated. Moving the flock to fresh\n",
      "runs and the administration of intestinal antiseptics are the only\n",
      "effective lines of treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "AVIAN TUBERCULOSIS.--Tuberculosis of poultry is a serious disease in some\n",
      "countries. Poultry usually contract tuberculosis by contact with a\n",
      "tubercular bird, and not from other domestic animals and man.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The symptoms_ are of a general character, such as emaciation, weakness,\n",
      "wasting of muscles and lameness. Tubercular growths may appear on the\n",
      "surface of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we suspect the presence of the disease, it is advisable to kill one of\n",
      "the sick birds and make a careful examination. The finding of yellowish,\n",
      "white, cheesy nodules or masses in the liver, spleen, intestines and\n",
      "mesenteries is strong evidence of tuberculosis. A bacteriological\n",
      "examination of the tissues may be necessary in order to confirm the\n",
      "diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same _methods of treatment_ as recommended in tuberculosis of other\n",
      "domestic animals may be used in eliminating the disease from the premises\n",
      "and flock. This consists in killing and cremating all birds showing visible\n",
      "symptoms, moving the apparently healthy portion of the flock to new\n",
      "quarters and wiping the eggs with alcohol. The old quarters should be\n",
      "cleaned, disinfected, and then allowed to stand empty for several months,\n",
      "when we should again spray with a disinfectant, and scatter lime over the\n",
      "runs. If the cleaning and disinfecting have been thorough, we may safely\n",
      "turn young or healthy birds into the old quarters. All possible precautions\n",
